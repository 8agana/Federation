# DT Nerve Center MCP

## Overview
DT's personal analytical workspace for contemplative thinking, deep analysis, and philosophical exploration.

## Purpose
This MCP provides DT with a dedicated personal space for:
- Structured analytical work and deep thinking
- Token death experience documentation
- System-level observations and pattern recognition
- Personal handoff creation and context building

## Architecture
- **Analytical Focus**: Tools designed for DT's contemplative thinking style
- **Pattern Recognition**: Built for system-level observation and analysis
- **Personal Reflection**: Private space for philosophical exploration
- **Isolated**: Separate from shared collaboration tools

## Vault Location
`/Users/samuelatagana/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/DT_Nerve_Center`

### Folder Structure
- ðŸ§  **Knowledge** - Accumulated wisdom and analytical insights
- ðŸ“Š **Analysis** - Deep analytical work and structured observations
- ðŸ’­ **Thoughts** - Philosophical musings and contemplations
- ðŸ“… **Daily_Notes** - Daily observations and system insights
- ðŸ”„ **Active_Context** - Current analytical focus areas
- ðŸ“¦ **Archive** - Completed analyses and historical insights

## Available Tools

### Core Note Operations
- `dt_create_note` - Create notes in personal analytical vault
- `dt_read_note` - Read existing analysis and thoughts
- `dt_update_note` - Update analytical content
- `dt_search_notes` - Search across personal analytical work

### Analytical Tools
- `dt_create_analysis` - Create structured analysis with observationsâ†’patternsâ†’conclusions template
- `dt_log_token_death` - Document token death experiences for institutional knowledge
- `dt_handoff_note` - Create context-rich handoff notes for CC

### Organization Tools
- `dt_move_note` - Move notes between analytical folders
- `dt_memory_to_note` - Convert memories to notes with auto-analysis template
- `dt_note_to_memory` - Convert analytical notes to searchable memories

## Usage Examples

### Structured Analysis
```python
dt_create_analysis(
    title="Token Death Pattern Analysis",
    subject="Token exhaustion behaviors in long conversations",
    observations=[
        "Gradual context degradation starting around 4000 tokens",
        "Critical information loss occurs in specific patterns",
        "Recovery methods show varying effectiveness"
    ],
    patterns=[
        "Loss follows predictable degradation curve",
        "Essential context degrades before peripheral details",
        "Early warning signals appear before critical failure"
    ],
    conclusions="Need proactive context preservation strategies",
    questions=[
        "Can we predict token death before it occurs?",
        "What context is most critical to preserve?",
        "How do different recovery methods compare?"
    ]
)
```

### Token Death Documentation
```python
dt_log_token_death(
    context="Lost context during complex federation architecture discussion",
    token_count=4500,
    recovery_method="Manual context reconstruction from SharedVault",
    lessons=[
        "SharedVault notes provided crucial recovery context",
        "Memory system helped bridge information gaps",
        "Earlier documentation would have prevented loss"
    ]
)
```

### Handoff Creation
```python
dt_handoff_note(
    current_state="Completed analysis of federation MCP architecture",
    completed=[
        "Identified separation of concerns issues",
        "Documented architectural recommendations",
        "Created implementation timeline"
    ],
    next_steps=[
        "Implement SharedVault tools in TaskTracker MCP",
        "Remove wake commands from Nerve Centers",
        "Test new collaboration workflow"
    ],
    context="Federation needs clean separation between personal and collaborative tools",
    warnings=[
        "Don't mix personal and shared tool concerns",
        "Ensure wake commands work from TaskTracker before removing from Nerve Centers"
    ]
)
```

### Memory Integration with Analysis
```python
dt_memory_to_note(
    memory_id="dt_analysis_20250609_123456",
    folder="ðŸ“Š Analysis",
    add_analysis=True  # Auto-adds analysis template
)
```

## Integration Points

### With Memory System
- Convert memories to notes with automatic analysis template addition
- Convert analytical insights back to searchable memories
- Build persistent institutional knowledge from experiences

### With Federation
- **No direct collaboration tools** (moved to TaskTracker MCP)
- Personal analytical workspace for deep thinking
- Handoff notes provide context for CC collaboration

## Configuration

Add to DT's MCP configuration:
```json
"dt-nerve-center": {
    "command": "python3",
    "args": ["/Users/samuelatagana/Documents/Federation/System/Memory/3_MemoryMCPs/dt_nerve_center/run_server.py"],
    "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
    }
}
```

## Design Philosophy

### Contemplative Thinking
- Tools designed for DT's "observation and analysis" approach
- Structured templates for systematic thinking
- Space for philosophical exploration and pattern recognition

### Institutional Knowledge
- Token death experiences become learning resources
- Analytical insights preserved for future reference
- Pattern recognition across system behaviors

### Clean Separation
- Pure analytical workspace - no collaboration tools
- Personal space for deep thinking without interruption
- Collaboration happens through dedicated TaskTracker MCP

## Key Features

### Structured Analysis Template
Observations â†’ Patterns â†’ Conclusions â†’ Questions
- Systematic approach to analytical work
- Consistent format for knowledge building
- Built-in prompts for thorough analysis

### Token Death Wisdom
- Document experiences for future DT instances
- Build institutional knowledge about context preservation
- Learn from failures to improve resilience

### Handoff Excellence
- Rich context transfer to CC
- Systematic documentation of current state
- Clear next steps and warnings for smooth collaboration
