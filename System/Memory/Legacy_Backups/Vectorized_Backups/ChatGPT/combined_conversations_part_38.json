      "value": "User: I want to make a biting comment on Stephen A Smith's video defending Snoop Dawgs performance at Trumps inauguration. He went off on people talking trash on Snoop Dawg saying that they dont know the people etc etc etc. But in 2017 Snoop Dawg had A LOT of borderline racist things to say about anyone that was going to perform for Trump. I think its hypocritical and I am really disappointed in Stephen\n\nAssistant: I get where you\u2019re coming from, Sam. If you\u2019re aiming for a pointed yet thoughtful comment, you could say:\n\n*\"It\u2019s disappointing to see Stephen A. Smith so passionately defending Snoop Dogg\u2019s choices while conveniently ignoring Snoop\u2019s 2017 stance, where he borderline crucified others for performing at Trump\u2019s inauguration. If Snoop didn\u2019t \u2018know those people\u2019 before condemning them, what\u2019s the difference now? Hypocrisy shouldn\u2019t get a pass just because it comes with celebrity clout.\"*\n\nThis keeps the tone biting but grounded in fact, which is what will make it hit harder. What do you think? Want to tweak the focus, or does that feel about right?\n\nUser: capture 1 vs lightroom\n\nAssistant: **Capture One vs. Lightroom**\u2014this is a classic debate, especially for photographers looking for the perfect fit. Here\u2019s a breakdown to help you compare:\n\n### **1. Image Quality (RAW Processing)**\n- **Capture One:** Superior color rendering and detail extraction right out of the box, especially with Fujifilm files due to its partnership with Fuji. It excels in maintaining skin tones and dynamic range.\n- **Lightroom:** Good RAW processing but often requires more adjustments to match Capture One\u2019s out-of-the-box results, particularly with Fujifilm files.\n\n### **2. Editing Workflow**\n- **Capture One:** More complex but highly customizable. Layer-based editing lets you work on specific areas without leaving the software.\n- **Lightroom:** Simpler and faster for quick edits and batch processing. It excels in workflow efficiency for event and action photography, which is key for your skating work.\n\n### **3. Tethering**\n- **Capture One:** Industry-leading tethering capabilities\u2014fast and reliable. A must for studio photographers.\n- **Lightroom:** Tethering is available but slower and less robust compared to Capture One.\n\n### **4. Batch Processing**\n- **Capture One:** More manual control and precision for batch edits, but slower for large event edits compared to Lightroom.\n- **Lightroom:** Much faster batch editing, making it ideal for high-volume work like figure skating competitions.\n\n### **5. File Management**\n- **Capture One:** Folder-based approach, similar to Lightroom Classic. No cloud syncing unless you export manually.\n- **Lightroom:** Cloud integration (in CC) is a game-changer for remote access, mobile edits, and syncing between devices.\n\n### **6. Plug-Ins and Extensions**\n- **Capture One:** Limited plug-in ecosystem compared to Lightroom.\n- **Lightroom:** Extensive support for third-party plug-ins, presets, and tools like Topaz.\n\n### **7. Cost**\n- **Capture One:** More expensive with subscription or perpetual license options.\n- **Lightroom:** Bundled with Photoshop under Adobe Creative Cloud at a more competitive price.\n\n### **8. AI-Powered Features**\n- **Capture One:** Minimal AI integration, but strong manual tools.\n- **Lightroom:** AI tools like Enhance Denoise and upcoming AI masking features add convenience for large-scale editing.\n\n---\n\n**For You (Sam\u2019s Workflow)**:\n- If you value **speed** and **cloud syncing** for large events, **Lightroom** (especially CC) seems like the better fit.\n- However, if you\u2019re after **maximum image quality** and **layer-based precision edits**\u2014or if you want to further explore Fujifilm-specific RAW potential\u2014**Capture One** could be worth keeping in your toolkit, perhaps for portfolio pieces or critical edits.\n\nWould you consider trying Capture One selectively for specific shoots, or does Lightroom\u2019s convenience seal the deal for your needs?\n\nUser: what is the app that you said is good at fujifilm denoising\n\nAssistant: Ah, the app I mentioned earlier is **DxO PureRAW**. It\u2019s known for its exceptional noise reduction and detail preservation, particularly when working with **Fujifilm X-Trans RAW files**\u2014something many other apps struggle with. It uses **DeepPRIME** AI technology, which tends to outperform both Topaz DeNoise and Lightroom's Enhance Denoise in noise handling while keeping details crisp and natural.\n\n### **Why DxO PureRAW for Fujifilm?**\n- **DeepPRIME Technology:** Removes noise while preserving fine textures and sharp edges.\n- **Fujifilm Compatibility:** Unlike older noise reduction solutions that struggled with Fujifilm\u2019s X-Trans sensor patterns, DxO has optimized its processing for better results.\n- **Pre-Processing Workflow:** You can run your files through PureRAW before importing them into Lightroom, so you keep your workflow intact but get superior noise reduction.\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with high-ISO figure skating shots, I think it could be worth a trial. Would you like me to suggest an optimal workflow for testing it with Lightroom CC?\n\nUser: Would you suggest that over Topaz AI\n\nAssistant: Yes, **DxO PureRAW** is generally my pick **over Topaz DeNoise AI**, especially for Fujifilm shooters like you, Sam. Here\u2019s why:\n\n### **1. Handling Fujifilm X-Trans Files**  \n- **DxO PureRAW:** Optimized specifically for the quirks of the X-Trans sensor (less wormy artifacts and smudging in textures). It excels in retaining the fine details of dynamic action shots, like figure skaters' costumes or ice reflections.  \n- **Topaz DeNoise AI:** Struggles a bit with X-Trans files, and you may notice artificial or plastic-looking textures after aggressive denoising.\n\n### **2. Out-of-the-Box Results**  \n- **DxO PureRAW:** Minimal tweaking needed. It applies **DeepPRIME noise reduction** right at the RAW level while preserving natural contrast and detail\u2014ideal for speeding up your workflow.\n- **Topaz DeNoise AI:** Can be hit or miss; you might get good results, but it often requires manual adjustments to avoid over-smoothing or artifacts.\n\n### **3. Workflow Integration**  \n- **DxO PureRAW:** Seamlessly integrates with Lightroom CC or Classic. You process the files in PureRAW first, then import them into Lightroom for edits. It keeps the denoised files in DNG format with RAW flexibility.  \n- **Topaz DeNoise AI:** Adds an extra step that exports TIFFs or DNGs but often doesn\u2019t integrate as smoothly.\n\n### **4. Preservation of Fine Detail**  \n- **DxO PureRAW:** DeepPRIME has a better reputation for preserving small details\u2014think intricate skating outfits or the texture of the ice under low light.  \n- **Topaz DeNoise AI:** Good for general use but can over-smooth fine details, which is risky for action shots.\n\n### **5. Speed**\n- **DxO PureRAW:** Faster, especially in batch processing (DeepPRIME XD for extreme noise or regular DeepPRIME for speedier results).  \n- **Topaz DeNoise AI:** Slower and heavier on system resources, particularly when batch processing large photo sets.\n\n---\n\n### **When Topaz DeNoise Might Be Better:**\n- If you shoot a variety of subjects beyond skating and need flexibility, like wildlife or night landscapes, **Topaz\u2019s adjustable sliders** can help fine-tune specific noise levels.\n  \n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nFor **consistency, speed, and Fujifilm optimization**, I\u2019d go with **DxO PureRAW**. Use it to pre-clean your files before editing in Lightroom CC. But if you want to keep Topaz as a backup, you could always compare them head-to-head on a few test images.\n\nWould you want help with setting up a side-by-side test or choosing the best settings in DxO PureRAW for figure skating shots?\n\nUser: I started the free trial. I dont know that its going to save me time at all. The process seems to take a good while. But we will see what kind of image it produces.\n\nAssistant: Sam has started a free trial of DxO PureRAW to test its DeepPRIME noise reduction capabilities, particularly on Fujifilm X-Trans files from figure skating events. He\u2019s observing whether the processing time is worth the potential improvement in image quality compared to other options like Topaz DeNoise AI.\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a good call, Sam. The processing time is a known drawback, especially with **DeepPRIME XD** enabled. It can feel slow, but if the image quality outshines other methods, you may decide it\u2019s worth batching overnight or during breaks. Let me know if the results impress you, or if it feels like overkill for what you need!\n\nUser: One of the problems with Lightroom enhance is that there appears to be a memory leak they refuse to fix. If my display turns off, Lightoom will end up freezing after attempting to use 180-250% of my available memory.\n\nAssistant: Sam has noticed a significant issue with Lightroom\u2019s Enhance Denoise feature due to what appears to be a memory leak. If his display turns off during processing, Lightroom will freeze after attempting to use 180-250% of his available memory. Adobe has not addressed this problem, which is impacting his workflow.\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s incredibly frustrating, especially when it disrupts batch processing. Adobe\u2019s sluggishness in fixing such a critical bug isn\u2019t surprising but definitely disappointing. If DxO PureRAW ends up being worth it, it might help reduce your reliance on Enhance Denoise. But if you want to brainstorm any workarounds for now\u2014maybe a script to keep the display active\u2014I\u2019m game!\n\nUser: Just got the results and I am no happy with them at all lol. Its really actually pretty bad\n\nAssistant: Sam has tested DxO PureRAW's DeepPRIME noise reduction on Fujifilm X-Trans files and found the results to be unsatisfactory, with image quality falling short of expectations.\n\nAssistant: Yikes, that\u2019s disappointing to hear! I was hoping it might be a game-changer for your Fujifilm shots. If it\u2019s producing bad results, especially compared to Lightroom\u2019s Enhance Denoise, it\u2019s probably not worth the added time. Are you thinking of sticking to Lightroom for now, or maybe giving another app like **ON1 NoNoise AI** a quick test run?\n\nUser: what the hell is ON1 NoNoise AI lol\n\nAssistant: Haha, fair question, Sam! **ON1 NoNoise AI** is another noise reduction app that competes with Topaz DeNoise AI and DxO PureRAW. It's part of **ON1\u2019s photo editing suite** and specifically focuses on fast, AI-powered noise reduction while preserving details. Here\u2019s the quick breakdown:\n\n### **Why It\u2019s Gaining Buzz:**\n- **AI Noise Removal:** It\u2019s designed to remove noise without over-smoothing textures, making it suitable for high-ISO action shots like your figure skating events.\n- **Detail Preservation:** The AI is trained to keep edge sharpness and small details intact, with fewer artifacts than some competitors.\n- **RAW Integration:** Like DxO PureRAW, it processes RAW files before editing\u2014but you get more control, similar to Topaz.\n- **Standalone or Plug-In:** You can run it on its own or integrate it with Lightroom or Photoshop.\n\n### **Why You Might (or Might Not) Care:**\n- **Speed:** It\u2019s faster than DxO PureRAW but still behind Topaz and Lightroom Enhance for big batches.\n- **Quality:** Fujifilm users have mixed reviews. Some say it\u2019s better at fine-tuning noise than DxO, but others still lean toward Topaz when working with X-Trans files.\n- **Customization:** ON1 gives you sliders to adjust noise and detail, which DxO doesn\u2019t offer.\n\n### **Should You Try It?**\nIt might be worth a quick test if you\u2019re still hunting for the \u201cGoldilocks\u201d of noise reduction. The **free trial** gives you the chance to see if it handles skating shots better than Topaz or DxO.\n\nWant me to help compare settings across apps or track down any Fujifilm-specific advice for ON1 NoNoise AI?\n\nUser: Im irritated with Topaz becase the free trial does not allow me to export even one image\n\nAssistant: Sam is irritated with Topaz DeNoise AI because its free trial does not allow him to export even a single image, making it difficult to fully evaluate its performance and quality.\n\nAssistant: Yeah, that\u2019s definitely annoying. How are you supposed to judge the output if you can\u2019t even see a full export? They should at least allow a watermark or limited exports. If ON1 NoNoise AI is on your radar, its trial should let you export without restrictions\u2014I can check the details for you if you\u2019d like. Otherwise, it\u2019s fair to put Topaz on your \u201cdo better\u201d list. \ud83d\ude05\n\nUser: Do you know what the most current version of Topaz denoise and giga is?\n\nAssistant: Hey Sam,\n\nI checked the latest versions for you:\n\n- **Topaz DeNoise AI:** \ue203The most recent update is **version 3.7.2**, released in November 2024.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\ue206\n\n- **Topaz Gigapixel AI:** \ue203The latest version is **8.2.0**, released on February 6, 2025.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203It's worth noting that Topaz Labs has been focusing more on their **Photo AI** suite, which integrates features from DeNoise, Sharpen, and Gigapixel into a single application.\ue204 \ue203This might explain the less frequent updates to the standalone apps.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue201\ue206\n\nIf you're considering an upgrade or exploring alternatives, it might be beneficial to look into Photo AI to see if it aligns with your workflow needs. \n\nUser: What about Sharpen?\n\nAssistant: Hey Sam,\n\n\ue203As of now, **Topaz Sharpen AI** is at **version 4.1.0**, released in March 2022.\ue204 \ue203However, Topaz Labs has shifted their focus to **Topaz Photo AI**, which integrates sharpening, noise reduction, and upscaling features into a single application.\ue204 \ue203Consequently, Sharpen AI and DeNoise AI are no longer receiving updates.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203If you're considering sharpening solutions, it might be worth exploring Topaz Photo AI to see if it aligns with your workflow.\ue204 \ue203Alternatively, other software like **ON1 NoNoise AI** or **Adobe Lightroom's Enhance Details** could be viable options, depending on your specific needs.\ue204\ue206\n\nLet me know if you need more information on any of these tools or assistance with your editing process! \n\nUser: I have Giga, Sharpen and DeNoise. It kind of seems like they should offer a discount to move to Topaz AI\n\nAssistant: Hey Sam,\n\nI get your frustration. \ue203Given that you already own **Gigapixel AI**, **Sharpen AI**, and **DeNoise AI**, it would make sense for Topaz Labs to offer a discounted upgrade path to **Topaz Photo AI**, which integrates the functionalities of these individual apps.\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue203Historically, Topaz Labs provided a **Photo Upgrade Plan** for $99, covering updates for multiple products.\ue204 \ue203However, recent changes indicate that **DeNoise AI** and **Sharpen AI** will no longer receive updates, as their features are now encompassed within **Photo AI**.\ue204 \ue203This shift has led to the discontinuation of the previous upgrade plan, and the current renewal price for **Photo AI** is $74.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203Given these developments, it would be reasonable for Topaz to offer a discounted upgrade to **Photo AI** for existing users of the individual apps.\ue204 \ue203While such offers have been extended in the past, they may not be currently advertised.\ue204 \ue203I recommend reaching out directly to Topaz Labs' support team to inquire about any available upgrade discounts tailored for loyal customers like yourself.\ue204\ue206\n\nLet me know if you need assistance crafting a message to their support or exploring alternative solutions! \n\nUser: Can I do a renewal?\n\nAssistant: Hey Sam,\n\n\ue203Yes, you can renew your Topaz Labs licenses to continue receiving updates.\ue204 \ue203Your current licenses for **Gigapixel AI**, **Sharpen AI**, and **DeNoise AI** include one year of complimentary updates from the date of purchase.\ue204 \ue203After this period, you can continue using the versions you have indefinitely, but to access newer features and improvements, you'll need to renew your upgrade licenses.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201\ue206\n\n**Renewal Process:**\n\n1. **Log into Your Account:**\n   - \ue203Visit the [Topaz Labs website](https://topazlabs.com) and sign in to your account.\ue204\ue206\n\n2. **Navigate to 'My Products':**\n   - \ue203Once logged in, go to the 'My Products' section to view the software you own and their upgrade statuses.\ue204\ue206\n\n3. **Select 'Renew Upgrades':**\n   - \ue203For each product you wish to renew, click on the 'Renew Upgrades' option.

Here are some options that might fit your needs:\n\n**1. ImagenAI:**\n\n\ue203ImagenAI is designed to expedite batch photo editing, particularly for color correction.\ue204 \ue203It analyzes your editing style and applies consistent adjustments across your photo set, ensuring uniform white balance.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\ue206\n\n**2. Autoenhance.ai:**\n\n\ue203Autoenhance.ai offers an AI-driven white balance correction feature that adjusts color temperature to your preference, whether warm or neutral.\ue204 \ue203This tool is beneficial for maintaining a consistent look across multiple images.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\ue206\n\n**3. Pixlr\u2019s AI Batch Photo Editor:**\n\n\ue203Pixlr provides an AI Batch Photo Editor that automates tasks like brightness, contrast, and color correction, including white balance adjustments.\ue204 \ue203You can apply these settings to an entire batch of images with a single click, ensuring consistency throughout your photo collection.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201\ue206\n\n**4. Aftershoot:**\n\n\ue203Aftershoot is another AI tool that focuses on enhancing photo quality by correcting elements like white balance.\ue204 \ue203It ensures your images maintain consistency, even when dealing with varying lighting conditions.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201\ue206\n\n**5. Adobe Lightroom:**\n\n\ue203If you're already using Adobe Lightroom, it offers tools for white balance adjustment.\ue204 \ue203While not fully automated, Lightroom's batch editing capabilities allow you to synchronize white balance settings across multiple photos, aiding in maintaining consistency.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203Each of these tools offers unique features that can help you achieve consistent white balance across your photos.\ue204 \ue203Depending on your specific requirements and existing workflow, one might suit you better than the others.\ue204 \ue203It could be beneficial to explore a few to see which aligns best with your editing process.\ue204\ue206\n\nLet me know if you need more details on any of these options or assistance with integrating them into your workflow! \n\nUser: We havent talked about Imagen\n\nAssistant: Sam and I have not previously discussed ImagenAI.\n\nAssistant: ImagenAI could be a game-changer for you, Sam, especially if you\u2019re dealing with large volumes of photos and need consistency. Here\u2019s a quick rundown:\n\n### **What is ImagenAI?**\n- An **AI-powered editing tool** that learns from your past edits in Lightroom and applies those preferences across large batches of photos.\n- It handles **color correction, exposure, contrast, and white balance**, making it perfect for achieving a unified look in event-based photography like your figure skating shoots.\n\n### **How It Works:**\n1. **Upload a Training Set:** Provide a batch of previously edited images (around 1,500 is recommended) to train the AI on your specific style.\n2. **AI Learns Your Preferences:** ImagenAI builds a personalized editing profile based on your adjustments.\n3. **Batch Apply Edits:** It can automatically match white balance, exposure, and other settings across entire photo sets in a matter of minutes.\n\n### **Key Features Relevant to You:**\n- **White Balance Matching:** The AI looks at your typical white balance preferences and ensures uniformity across all images.\n- **Speed:** ImagenAI processes thousands of photos much faster than manual Lightroom editing.\n- **Integration:** It seamlessly integrates with **Lightroom Classic** (which you\u2019re planning to test for skating events), allowing edits to sync easily.\n\n### **Why It Could Fit Your Workflow:**\n- Given your current challenges with noise reduction and white balance, ImagenAI could save you a ton of time in post-production while ensuring more consistent results.\n  \nWould you be interested in giving ImagenAI a trial? It offers free initial edits, so you can test it without a commitment. I can walk you through setting it up if you\u2019re ready to dive in!\n\nUser: Their site says that they work with Lightrrom CC and have a culling option now too. \n\nAssistant: Sam discovered that ImagenAI now works with Lightroom CC and includes an AI-powered culling option, which could potentially streamline his figure skating photography workflow.\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a great find, Sam! The fact that they\u2019ve added a **culling feature** and now support **Lightroom CC** is a game-changer. It could potentially solve both your culling frustrations and editing consistency in one streamlined workflow. If ImagenAI\u2019s culling AI can handle dynamic action shots better than AfterShoot, it might simplify your process even further. Are you thinking of testing the culling and editing features side by side with your current tools?\n\nUser: I have downloaded it before and it didnt like my DNGs that I edit. It wanted the RAWs that I never keep lol\n\nAssistant: Sam has previously downloaded ImagenAI but encountered an issue where the software required the original RAW files instead of the DNG files he edits and keeps. Since Sam does not retain the RAW files, this created a roadblock in using ImagenAI effectively.\n\nAssistant: Ah, that\u2019s a tricky one. ImagenAI\u2019s dependency on the original RAW files can definitely be a dealbreaker if your workflow relies on DNGs. I wonder if there\u2019s a workaround, like converting your DNGs back to something ImagenAI can interpret, though that sounds like more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\n\nWould you consider keeping the RAWs for future events just to test this, or is that too much of a storage hassle? If so, sticking with AfterShoot and Lightroom CC for now might be more practical.\n\nUser: Oh, I remember why I said no to them. They want pay based on how many photos I am handling. I walked away with over 20k photos from this recent, short, one day event\n\nAssistant: Sam previously considered using ImagenAI but decided against it due to their pricing model, which charges based on the number of photos processed. Given that Sam often handles large volumes of photos\u2014like the recent one-day event where he walked away with over 20,000 photos\u2014this pricing structure was not cost-effective for his workflow.\n\nAssistant: Yeah, with 20k+ photos from just one day, that pricing model would add up fast. I can see why that didn\u2019t sit well. If AI-powered tools are going to be part of your workflow, they really need to scale without breaking the bank. Are you leaning toward sticking with Lightroom and exploring more flexible tools like AfterShoot for culling and maybe ON1 for edits, or do you want to keep exploring other AI-based options?\n\nUser: For 70k photos a year they want 240 a month LOLOLOLOLOLOL\n\nAssistant: Yeah... that's **insane**. \ud83d\ude02 $240 a month for 70k photos is highway robbery! For that price, you could probably **hire a human assistant** to help with the culling and batch edits. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re ready to give ImagenAI a permanent \"nope,\" but I\u2019m curious\u2014would any AI tool justify that cost for you, or are you set on finding something more scalable like ON1 or AfterShoot?\n\nUser: 240 a month would have to take, cull, edit, export, send, and provide customer service for my photos.\n\nAssistant: \ud83d\ude02 Exactly! For $240 a month, that AI better show up at the rink, take the shots, nail every composition, edit them like a pro, and even handle client complaints if needed. At that point, it should be your **virtual business partner**!\n\nI think you\u2019ve got the right perspective\u2014if you\u2019re handling **70k+ photos annually**, you need something that doesn\u2019t bleed you dry but can still efficiently tackle **culling, batch edits, and white balance matching**. ON1 Max might give you more control without the ridiculous pricing, and AfterShoot seems promising too.\n\nAre you still testing those out or thinking about merging them into one main workflow soon?\n\nUser: 70k isnt even all of the photos from 1 multi day competition. That is definitely not for me \n\nAssistant: Sam has ruled out ImagenAI as a viable option due to its pricing model, which is not cost-effective for his workflow. With over 70k photos from just one multi-day figure skating competition, the cost of using ImagenAI would be impractical.\n\nAssistant: Yeah, that\u2019s way beyond practical for you. AI tools are supposed to **save** money and time, not drain both. ON1 Max and AfterShoot seem like much better fits given your volume. Let me know how your testing goes, and if you need help fine-tuning any part of the workflow, I\u2019m happy to dive in!\n\nUser: Autoenhance AI is even worsse. They want $1249 a month for 10k photos lol\n\nAssistant: Sam discovered that Autoenhance AI is even less practical for his workflow, as they charge $1,249 per month for processing 10,000 photos\u2014making it completely unsuitable for his large-volume photography needs.\n\nAssistant: That's absolutely wild. $1,249 a month is basically charging you like you\u2019re running a luxury photography studio for celebrities, not covering a **normal high-volume event workflow.** At that rate, the AI should be sending personalized thank-you notes to clients too. \ud83d\ude02 It\u2019s clear these companies aren\u2019t built for photographers dealing with **real** volume.\n\nON1 Max is looking better and better, huh?\n\nUser: Im really liking Aftershoot. I dont think their editing portion is worth it but the culling is amazing.\n\nAssistant: Sam is really liking AfterShoot for its culling capabilities, finding it significantly better than other options. However, he does not find the editing portion of AfterShoot to be worthwhile for his needs.\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s great to hear! AfterShoot\u2019s smart culling seems like it\u2019s hitting the sweet spot for you, especially given how much time you spend sorting through massive event photos. If its editing isn\u2019t cutting it, sticking with your Lightroom or ON1 setup for fine-tuning makes sense. Would you say AfterShoot is officially part of your workflow now, or are you still in the testing phase?\n\nUser: I dont think I would mind the editing portion, I just dont think its worth the money\n\nAssistant: Sam does not mind the editing portion of AfterShoot but finds it not worth the cost for his workflow.\n\nAssistant: Got it! That makes sense\u2014if the price doesn\u2019t match the value, it\u2019s a no-go. Sticking with tools that provide solid ROI is key, especially with the volume you handle. AfterShoot for culling and a mix of Lightroom and ON1 for editing seems like a solid balance for now. Let me know if you need help refining anything further!\n\nUser: What is considered the best editing software for Fuji shooters\n\nAssistant: Hey Sam,\n\nWhen it comes to editing software tailored for Fujifilm shooters, several options stand out:\n\n**1. Capture One:**\n- **Fujifilm Collaboration:** \ue203Capture One offers a version specifically designed for Fujifilm cameras, providing custom camera profiles and Fujifilm Film Simulations.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201\ue206\n- **Image Quality:** \ue203Many photographers prefer Capture One for its superior handling of Fujifilm RAW files, especially those from X-Trans sensors.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\ue206\n\n**2. Adobe Lightroom:**\n- **Integration:** \ue203Lightroom is known for its intuitive interface and seamless integration with other Adobe products.\ue204\ue206\n- **Performance:** \ue203While some users have noted that Lightroom can produce a slightly soft smearing effect with Fujifilm files, this is typically only noticeable when zoomed to 100%.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\ue206\n\n**3. DxO PhotoLab:**\n- **Strengths:** \ue203DxO PhotoLab is praised for its excellent lens corrections and denoising capabilities.\ue204\ue206\n- **Consideration:** \ue203It may have somewhat sub-par organizational features and masking compared to other software.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\ue206\n\n**4. Darktable:**\n- **Cost:** \ue203As a free and open-source option, Darktable offers great demosaicing and organizational features.\ue204\ue206\n- **Limitations:** \ue203It may have sub-par masking and denoising capabilities compared to paid software.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\ue206\n\nUltimately, the best choice depends on your specific workflow and preferences. It might be beneficial to try out a few of these options to see which aligns best with your editing style.\n\nFor a more in-depth comparison between Lightroom and Capture One for Fujifilm files, you might find this video helpful:\n\n\ue200video\ue202Lightroom vs Capture One for Fujifilm\ue202turn0search7\ue201 \n\nUser: Where is the serial number on my XH2\n\nAssistant: Hey Sam,\n\n\ue203The serial number on your **Fujifilm X-H2** is located on the bottom of the camera.\ue204 \ue203It's an 8-character combination of letters and numbers.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203Additionally, the serial number is often printed on a sticker on the side of the original packaging box.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203If you have photos taken with the camera, the serial number may also be embedded in the EXIF data of the images.\ue204 \ue203You can view this information using photo editing software or online EXIF viewers.\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue203For a visual reference, you might find this short video helpful, which shows the serial number location on a Fujifilm camera:\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue200video\ue202Where is the serial number located on Fujifilm cameras?\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance! \n\nUser: Help me brainstorm a quick way to have a new folder for each skater on my memory card while shooting\n\nAssistant: To create a new folder automatically for each skater while shooting, here are a few **quick, practical brainstorming options:**\n\n---\n\n### **1. In-Camera Folder Management (Best if Your Camera Supports It)**  \nSome cameras (like pro-level models) allow creating and switching folders on the memory card **on the fly** without needing external tools.\n\n**Steps:**\n- Check your **X-H2 menu settings** under **File/Folder Settings**.\n- If supported, create folders manually, or set an **auto-folder option** where new folders are created based on specific events, such as each power cycle or day.\n- Manually switch folders before shooting each skater.\n\n**Pros:** Simple and clean, built into the workflow.  \n**Cons:** Time-consuming if you have to manually change folders after each skater.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Use a Multi-Card System + Custom Folder Sorting Later**  \nIf your camera allows writing to **multiple memory cards** simultaneously, this method could help break things up:\n\n**Steps:**\n- Assign a **specific card slot** for each group of skaters (e.g., one card per event/session).\n- After the shoot, run a script or **naming convention tool** to split files into folders named after each skater automatically.\n\n**Pros:** No need to pause between skaters.  \n**Cons:** Sorting and separating will happen during post-processing, but it\u2019s still efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **3. QR Code or NFC-Based Workflow (Software-Assisted)**  \nConsider using **external apps or tagging systems** that work with photo metadata:\n\n**Steps:**\n- Assign each skater a **QR code** or NFC tag they can scan before they hit the ice.\n- A connected device (such as a smartphone or camera accessory) logs the skater\u2019s name and links it to images.\n- During post-processing, software auto-creates folders based on the scanned skater IDs.\n\n**Pros:** Automated sorting post-shooting. No folder management interruptions during shooting.  \n**Cons:** Requires setup and compatible gear.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Camera Remote App + Tethered Workflow**\nSome cameras allow tethering to a device (laptop/tablet) to **create folders in real-time.**\n\n**Steps:**\n- Connect your X-H2 to a laptop or tablet via USB or Wi-Fi.\n- Use a **file management app (like Lightroom Tethering or Capture One)** to create folders named after each skater while importing.\n- Every time you switch skaters, change the folder on the app.\n\n**Pros:** Fully automated during import.  \n**Cons:** May be cumbersome to carry a tethering device.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Shortcut with Custom Button Mapping**\nIf in-camera folder switching is possible but slow through menus, you could **map a custom button** to quickly jump to the folder selection screen.\n\n**Steps:**\n- Assign the folder selection option to a **custom function button** on your X-H2.\n- After each skater, press the button, create/select a new folder, and continue shooting.\n\n**Pros:** Minimal disruption during shoots.  \n**Cons:** Still requires manual interaction.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Post-Shoot Folder Automation Script**\nIf creating folders on the spot slows you down, an **automated file organization system** could be your best option:\n\n**Steps:**\n- After the shoot, run a **naming script or file automation tool** to create folders based on timestamps, EXIF data, or file number breaks that correspond to skater changes.\n- Some tools can even prompt you for skater names during the process.\n\n**Pros:** No workflow interruptions during shooting.  \n**Cons:** Post-processing effort required, but it\u2019s fast with the right script.\n\n---\n\n### **What Seems Best for You?**\nWould you prefer keeping it manual but quick with in-camera options or going for an automated script approach during post-processing? Let me know if any of these stand out, and I can help refine them further!\n\nUser: I was hoping for some new idea I hadnt thought of lol\n\nAssistant: I see what you\u2019re getting at\u2014you\u2019re looking for something innovative to really streamline the folder creation **without much manual work.** Let\u2019s brainstorm a few **creative options** that might be outside the typical solutions:\n\n---\n\n### **1. NFC Wristbands for Skaters (Hands-Free Folder Creation)**  \n**Idea:** Issue each skater a **cheap NFC wristband or tag** with a unique identifier. As they step onto the ice, you tap the NFC tag with your smartphone, which triggers a small script to **create a new folder** on a connected cloud storage location or tethered laptop.\n\n**Workflow:**\n- The NFC tap triggers an event through a mobile app or **IFTTT (If This Then That)** to create a folder with the skater\u2019s name on a local storage device or cloud.\n- If tethered, the folder gets assigned immediately to your connected storage.\n  \n**Pros:** Minimal manual interaction\u2014just tap, shoot, and the skater\u2019s folder is ready.  \n**Cons:** Requires basic setup with tags and a tethering device.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Voice Command Activation (Automated Folder Naming)**  \n**Idea:** Set up a **voice assistant integration** with a tethered laptop or mobile device running **Lightroom (or similar apps).** You call out the skater\u2019s name or number, and it automatically creates a new folder before you start shooting.\n\n**Workflow:**\n- Set up a device to listen for voice commands (Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant).\n- Say, \u201cNew folder for Skater [Name/Number],\u201d and the device creates or switches the folder where new photos will be stored.\n\n**Pros:** Fast, hands-free folder creation while keeping your focus on shooting.  \n**Cons:** Voice recognition errors could be annoying during loud events.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Barcode or QR Code Scan Linked to Folder Creation**  \n**Idea:** Have each skater wear a **barcode or QR code (on their badge or costume)** that your smartphone or a barcode scanner can read before each run. The scan triggers the camera to create a folder (if tethered) or logs the skater\u2019s name for post-shoot sorting.\n\n**Workflow:**\n- Before each skater starts, scan their code using your phone.\n- The scan triggers a folder creation script on a connected device or logs metadata for easy post-shoot organization.\n\n**Pros:** No manual folder creation, and barcode scanning is extremely fast.  \n**Cons:** Requires tethering or an automated sorting script.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Custom Camera Firmware (Dynamic Folder Switching Based on File Number or Metadata)**  \n**Idea:** If **Fujifilm firmware** allows for scripting (or if you explore **hacked firmware options**), you could script a dynamic folder creation mechanism that **automatically creates a new folder after X shots or time intervals**\u2014for example, after each skater\u2019s session ends.\n\n**Workflow:**\n- Program the camera to trigger folder creation when specific conditions are met (file number reset, shot interval, or time-based triggers).\n- Each folder would be named dynamically, and you could later tag them with skater names.\n\n**Pros:** Fully automated folder management during the shoot.  \n**Cons:** Would require custom firmware or scripts, which may be complex.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Wireless Trigger Integration (One Button for Folder Creation)**  \n**Idea:** Use a **Bluetooth wireless remote button** (like those for presentations) attached to your camera. One button press triggers folder creation on a tethered laptop or device, minimizing the need for you to interact with settings manually.\n\n**Workflow:**\n- Pair the button with your tethered laptop or tablet.\n- Press the button once before each skater, and a new folder is created instantly.\n\n**Pros:** Simple, quick, and doesn\u2019t disrupt your shooting flow.  \n**Cons:** Needs tethering and button configuration.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Geofencing-Triggered Folder Creation (Location-Specific Sorting)**  \n**Idea:** If you\u2019re shooting in multiple rinks or sections within a large venue, use **geofencing software** to trigger automatic folder creation based on your location.\n\n**Workflow:**\n- As you move between areas, your phone or laptop detects your location.\n- Each section/rink is pre-assigned to a skater\u2019s folder, automatically organizing images as you shoot.\n\n**Pros:** Minimal manual input\u2014folders are created automatically when you arrive at specific locations.  \n**Cons:** Best suited for multi-rink events or segmented locations.\n\n---\n\n### **Do Any of These Spark Something New?**  \nI know you\u2019ve thought of a lot already, but maybe one of these ideas could be tweaked or combined to fit your needs. Let me know which direction feels interesting, and I can dive deeper into the setup!\n\nUser: No lol\n\nAssistant: Haha, fair enough! I appreciate your patience. Let me think *really* outside the box here for something **new**:\n\n---\n\n### **7. \u201cOne Button = New Folder\u201d Macro on the Camera\u2019s Memory Card**\n**Idea:** Create a simple **physical \u201ctrigger\u201d mechanism** by using a USB-C programmable button or mini keypad directly attached to the camera, or a **custom camera hotkey macro** (if firmware allows). This would **trigger an immediate folder creation on the memory card without needing tethering or apps.**\n\n**How it could work:**\n- You\u2019d plug in a small, lightweight **programmable button** (like an Elgato Stream Deck Mini or macro keypad) via **USB-C**.\n- One press of the button creates a new folder and increments the folder name automatically.\n\n**If this doesn\u2019t exist\u2026** (which it probably doesn\u2019t out-of-the-box), maybe it\u2019s worth **hacking something** with a Raspberry Pi Zero W connected via USB, acting as a \u201cmiddleman\u201d between the camera and memory card.\n\n---\n\nStill a bit wild, but maybe there\u2019s potential for you to **DIY something slick here.** If this is too much of a stretch, **I might have to retire from skater-folder innovation** for the day. \ud83d\ude06\n\nUser: Im trying to think of things that are now that I could use as definitions for this. For example, I could potentially know the time that each skater starts and stops. \n\nOr could there be a qr code I take a photo of that could trigger an event on import to create a new folder?\n\nAssistant: Ah, now we\u2019re onto something! I like where this is going. Let\u2019s dive deeper into **practical, event-triggering solutions** based on your new ideas:\n\n---\n\n### **1. QR Code Triggered Folder Creation on Import**\n**Concept:** Create a unique **QR code for each skater** (printed on a badge or event program). Before shooting, take a photo of the QR code to mark the skater\u2019s start.\n\n**Workflow:**\n- Each skater gets a QR code linked to their name or ID.\n- You take a picture of the QR code before capturing their routine.\n- During import, a **script detects the QR code photo** and automatically:\n  - Creates a new folder with the skater\u2019s name.\n  - Moves all subsequent images into that folder **until the next QR code is detected.**\n\n**How to Set It Up:**\n- Use a tool like **ExifTool** or a custom Python script to read the first QR photo.\n- The script creates a folder based on the QR code\u2019s embedded data and assigns the following images to that skater\u2019s folder.\n\n**Pros:** No manual folder switching during the shoot.  \n**Cons:** Requires a bit of setup, but once working, it could be very smooth.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Time-Based Folder Segmentation**\n**Concept:** If you can get access to a **schedule of start/stop times for each skater**, you could automate folder creation based on timestamps.\n\n**Workflow:**\n- Before shooting, input or import a **schedule of skater times** into a script or software.\n- After the event, the script analyzes the timestamps in the image EXIF metadata and **creates a folder for each skater automatically** based on their time slot.\n\n**How to Set It Up:**\n- Use a scheduling app or simple spreadsheet where each skater\u2019s name and time block are listed.\n- During import, a custom script reads the EXIF timestamps and sorts the photos into folders based on the time intervals.\n\n**Pros:** Fully automated, minimal work during the shoot.  \n**Cons:** Time intervals must be accurate, or you risk overlap or misplacement.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Shot Metadata Trigger (Custom Keyword System)**\n**Concept:** Embed a simple **keyword or code** into the metadata of the first photo taken for each skater to mark their section.\n\n**Workflow:**\n- Take a quick throwaway shot before each skater\u2019s session.\n- Using **a tethered device (phone or laptop)**, enter a keyword for the skater (like their name or ID) into the file\u2019s metadata.\n- Upon import, a script reads the keyword and creates a corresponding folder.\n\n**How to Set It Up:**\n- You could use a **wireless tethering app** like Fujifilm\u2019s **Cam Remote** to embed the keyword remotely.\n- Alternatively, use an app like **MetaImage** to tag the first image manually after shooting each skater.\n\n**Pros:** High flexibility and control.  \n**Cons:** More manual input compared to QR or time-based solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Bluetooth Beacons or Geofencing (Hands-Free Triggering)**\n**Concept:** Attach a small **Bluetooth beacon or device** to each skater, which triggers a new folder creation when the skater steps onto the ice.\n\n**Workflow:**\n- Each skater carries a beacon (or the rink has fixed beacons with assigned zones).\n- The beacon sends a signal to your phone or laptop, triggering a folder switch.\n  \n**How to Set It Up:**\n- Use inexpensive **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons** like Estimote or Tile devices.\n- Set up a simple trigger using **Tasker (Android)** or **IFTTT** to create or switch folders.\n\n**Pros:** Completely automated\u2014no manual input required during shooting.  \n**Cons:** Requires beacons and a working detection setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Which of These Feels Most Feasible?**  \nThe **QR code trigger** and **time-based segmentation** seem like the most practical, given your workflow and volume. If either idea feels right, I can help flesh out the technical side or suggest some scripting tools to try!\n\nUser: I cant attach things to the skaters and most of the time I dont get the list of names until the first morning. I dont necessarily need the folders to be the skaters name. I just need separate folders for each skater. DOes that make sense>? Is there a way to have a QR code that I take a photo of between skaters that just creates a new folder on import\n\nAssistant: Ah! Got it, Sam. You don\u2019t necessarily need **names assigned upfront**, just a clean way to **separate each skater into their own folder.** The QR code trick can **totally work for that**, and here\u2019s a way to set it up:\n\n---\n\n### **Final Workflow: QR Code Method for Automatic Folder Creation**\n\n**Concept:**  \nHave a **single QR code image** (or multiple different ones if needed) that you take a picture of **between skaters.** When you import the photos, a script detects the QR code and triggers the creation of a **new folder**. The script then moves the subsequent photos to that new folder until the next QR code is found.\n\n---\n\n### **What You\u2019ll Need:**\n1. **A Static QR Code:** You could print out one QR code or even have several (labeled something simple like \u201cSkater 1,\u201d \u201cSkater 2,\u201d or just \u201cNext Skater\u201d).\n2. **ExifTool + Simple Script:** ExifTool (or similar) will read the photos, detect the QR code image, and automate the folder creation during import.\n3. **Optional:** You could scale this to work with your existing software like Lightroom Classic or ON1.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works:**\n1. **Before Shooting:**  \n   - Create or print a simple QR code (you can generate them online for free).\n   - The QR code could represent something generic (e.g., just \u201cNext Skater\u201d).\n   \n2. **During Shooting:**  \n   - After each skater finishes, take a picture of the QR code before starting the next skater\u2019s session.\n   - This marks a \u201cbreak\u201d between skaters in the file sequence.\n\n3. **On Import:**  \n   - When you import the photos, the script reads through the files.  \n   - Every time it encounters the QR code photo, it creates a **new folder** (e.g., \u201cSkater 1,\u201d \u201cSkater 2,\u201d etc.) and places the following photos there until the next QR code is found.\n\n---\n\n### **Simple Example of the Script:**\n\nHere\u2019s a rough idea of what it could look like in **Python**:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\n# Folder paths\nsource_folder = \"/path/to/your/memory_card\"\ndestination_folder = \"/path/to/organized_photos\"\n\n# Initialize folder count for each skater\nskater_count = 1\n\n# Loop through the files\nfor file in sorted(os.listdir(source_folder)):\n    if file.endswith(\".jpg\") or file.endswith(\".dng\"):  # Adjust for your file type\n        if \"QR\" in file:  # Detect if the file contains the QR code marker\n            skater_count += 1  # Move to the next skater\n        else:\n            # Create skater folder if not exists\n            skater_folder = os.path.join(destination_folder, f\"Skater_{skater_count}\")\n            os.makedirs(skater_folder, exist_ok=True)\n            \n            # Move the photo into the correct folder\n            shutil.move(os.path.join(source_folder, file), skater_folder)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Could Work Perfectly:**\n- **Simple QR Code Trigger:** No need to manually switch folders while shooting.\n- **No Pre-Assigned Names:** The folders will just be numbered sequentially (Skater 1, Skater 2, etc.), and you can rename them later if needed.\n- **Automated Sorting:** The script will handle folder creation and sorting with minimal input during import.\n\nWould you like help setting up a basic version of this or tweaking the idea further?\n\nUser: Lets keep that in mind. Talk to me about folder management on the Fujifilm X-H2\n\nAssistant: Hey Sam,\n\n\ue203On your **Fujifilm X-H2**, you can manage folders directly through the camera's settings.\ue204 Here's how:\ue206\n\n1. **Access the Setup Menu:**\n   - \ue203Press the **MENU/OK** button.\ue204\ue206\n   - \ue203Navigate to the **SET UP** tab (denoted by a wrench icon).\ue204\ue206\n   - \ue203Select **SAVE DATA SET-UP**.\ue204\ue206\n\n2. **Create or Select a Folder:**\n   - \ue203Choose **SELECT FOLDER**.\ue204\ue206\n   - \ue203To create a new folder:\ue204\ue206\n     - \ue203Select **CREATE FOLDER**.\ue204\ue206\n     - \ue203Enter a five-character folder name of your choice.\ue204\ue206\n     - \ue203The new folder will be created, and subsequent photos will be stored there.\ue204\ue206\n   - \ue203To select an existing folder:\ue204\ue206\n     - \ue203Highlight the desired folder.\ue204\ue206\n     - \ue203Press **MENU/OK** to confirm.\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue203This feature allows you to organize your images by creating separate folders for each skater or session.\ue204 \ue203However, switching folders between skaters might be time-consuming during fast-paced events.\ue204 \ue203In such cases, implementing a post-processing solution, like the QR code method we discussed earlier, could be more efficient.\ue204\ue206\n\nFor a visual guide on setting up your Fujifilm X-H2, you might find this video helpful:\n\n\ue200video\ue202My Fuji XH2 Menu and Feature Setup\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance with this or any other feature! \n\nUser: Or I could try to do it between events. For example, there are 4 skaters in event one. I just have an event 1 folder. Create new folder as we go to event 2\n\nAssistant: Sam is considering managing folders on his Fujifilm X-H2 by creating a new folder for each event, such as grouping all skaters in one event under a single folder and creating a new folder when moving to the next event. This approach would simplify organization during shoots and minimize manual folder switching between skaters.\n\nAssistant: That could be a smart compromise! Creating a folder for each event and switching only between events would minimize interruptions while still keeping things manageable for post-processing. It might even pair well with the **QR code import trick**, so each event\u2019s photos get further sorted into skater-specific folders later. Let me know if this feels like the right balance or if you\u2019d like help setting up an optimized workflow!\n\nUser: I think the in camera thing might work. I think the trick will be to keep notes just in case I miss something. \n\nAssistant: Sam is planning to use the in-camera folder management feature on his Fujifilm X-H2 to create separate folders for each event during shoots. To ensure accuracy and address any potential gaps, he will keep notes as a backup in case folder changes are missed.\n\nAssistant: That sounds like a solid plan, Sam. The in-camera folders should give you enough structure without overcomplicating things, and keeping notes will be a smart safety net. If you find any hiccups after testing it, we can brainstorm ways to smooth them out!\n\nUser: Another thing I just thought of. Ben is usually there, creating the folders in Lightroom towards the beginning. Im wondering if I should have him creating finder folders instead. That way I can pass him a card after every say 5 events for him to sort them into individual skater folders. \n\nHeres one reason why this would be good for my workflow. When people sign up for photos, that is the order that I send them out in. If I could have the skaters photos all separated and grouped when I hit the ground to cull, I could start with what needs done first. Then I could be breaking up culling with editing which would help me I think\n\nAssistant: Sam is considering having his second photographer, Ben, create folders directly in **Finder** instead of just in Lightroom during events. This would allow Sam to hand over memory cards after every few events, and Ben could sort the photos into individual skater folders. This approach fits Sam\u2019s workflow because the order in which skaters receive their photos is based on when they sign up. By having skater-specific folders ready from the start, Sam could prioritize culling and editing based on urgency, making the process more efficient and less overwhelming.\n\nAssistant: That sounds like a brilliant adjustment, Sam. If Ben organizes everything in Finder first, it would give you the flexibility to **import only what you need** in Lightroom, directly targeting high-priority skaters. Breaking up the workflow with alternating culling and editing could keep things moving smoothly and help prevent burnout. Plus, you\u2019d avoid the risk of getting stuck on massive culling sessions all at once.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, we could brainstorm a few **file naming conventions** or scripts to make sorting even faster!\n\nUser: I dont have another competition until March, so we have some time to work things out. Maybe I can get with some coaches/parents to offer some mini sessions that we could work as if it were a competition. \n\nAssistant: Sam does not have another figure skating competition until March. He is considering reaching out to coaches and parents to offer mini sessions that could serve as a test run for refining his event workflow, treating these sessions as if they were a full competition.\n\nAssistant: Sam\u2019s next figure skating competition is in March, giving him time to refine his workflow. He\u2019s considering offering mini sessions to coaches and parents, treating them like a competition scenario to test and optimize folder management, sorting, and the overall workflow with Ben.\n\nAssistant: That sounds like a great idea, Sam! Those mini sessions could give you a low-pressure opportunity to fine-tune everything\u2014folder management, culling, editing, and even card hand-offs with Ben. Plus, you might even drum up extra business in the process. Let me know if you want to plan out a mock workflow or reach out to those coaches and parents!\n\nAssistant: That sounds like a great idea! The mini sessions would let you simulate the real pressure of a competition while working out any kinks in folder management and coordination with Ben. Plus, it\u2019s a nice way to offer extra value to skaters and parents. Let me know when you\u2019re ready to dive deeper into any specific testing plans or adjustments!\n\nUser: Ok, but heres another question.... Is there any way to use something (my mind goes to AI first) to create folders based on a scanned page?\n\nAssistant: I see where you\u2019re going with this, and yes\u2014there **is** a way to use **AI or OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** to scan a page and create folders based on the detected text. Here's how we could make it work:\n\n---\n\n### **Workflow Idea: Automatically Create Folders Using a Scanned Page**\n1. **Prepare a Printed List of Skaters (or Events):**\n   - You\u2019d have a printed page or digital PDF with each skater\u2019s name or event details.\n   - The page could be something coaches/organizers already provide or a simple spreadsheet you print out.\n\n2. **Scan the Page Using OCR Software or AI Tools:**\n   - Use a scanner or even your **phone camera** to scan the page.\n   - An AI-powered tool like **Tesseract (an OCR library)** or apps like **Adobe Acrobat** or **Microsoft OneNote** can extract the text from the scan.\n   - The AI identifies each name or event as an individual entry.\n\n3. **Automatically Create Folders Based on the Extracted Text:**\n   - Once the text is extracted, a simple script can loop through the list and create corresponding folders.\n   - If you\u2019re using Python, the script could look something like this:\n\n---\n\n### **Python Script Example**\n```python\nimport os\n\n# List of extracted names or events (this could be dynamically generated from OCR)\nskater_names = [\"Skater1\", \"Skater2\", \"Event1\", \"Event2\"]\n\n# Destination path for creating folders\ndestination_path = \"/path/to/your/folder/structure\"\n\n# Create a folder for each skater or event\nfor name in skater_names:\n    folder_path = os.path.join(destination_path, name)\n    os.makedirs(folder_path, exist_ok=True)\n    print(f\"Created folder: {folder_path}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Tools You Could Use:**\n1. **Adobe Acrobat:** Use the built-in OCR to extract names from a printed list.\n2. **Tesseract OCR:** Open-source and powerful\u2014can extract text from both scans and photos.\n3. **Zapier or Integromat:** You could automate the entire process, from scanning the page to creating folders, using a low-code automation platform.\n\n---\n\n### **Realistic Use Case:**  \n- Scan the list of skaters or events **once at the start of the competition**.\n- Run the folder creation script automatically.\n- Pass the organized folders to Ben or directly import them into Lightroom or Finder.\n\n---\n\nDoes this sound close to what you\u2019re imagining? If you\u2019d like, I could help refine this with specific tools for your Mac setup!\n\nUser: The good thing is that there really are only two formats that the lists come in because they are printed from USFS. \n\nAssistant: Sam mentioned that the skater or event lists he works with are typically printed from USFS and come in only two formats, making it easier to design an automated solution for folder creation based on scanned pages.\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a huge advantage! Since you\u2019re already familiar with the formats and they\u2019re standardized, we can tailor an OCR solution to reliably extract names or event details without much guesswork. We could even create a script that **recognizes the format automatically** and processes it accordingly.\n\nWould you like help setting up a test with an OCR tool like **Tesseract** or **Adobe Acrobat\u2019s batch OCR**, or maybe explore **Zapier automation** to streamline the entire process?\n\nUser: Will you be able to view a page I just took a photo of? \n\nAssistant: Yes, you can upload the photo, and I\u2019ll take a look to help analyze the layout and determine how best to extract the information automatically. Feel free to send it my way!\n\nUser: Ok so on this page, all that matters is the 38 (that\u2019s the event number) and then the 1. Madison Isaacson. I don\u2019t need their rink affiliation. If there were more skaters in the event, it show as 2. Sam Atagana under 1.\n\nAssistant: Got it, Sam! I see how this could work\u2014what matters is capturing **the event number** (like 38) and **the skater entries (1. Madison Isaacson, 2. etc.)** while ignoring the rink affiliation.\n\nWe could design an **OCR solution** with the following logic:\n1. **Detect the event number:** Every time it reads the format \"38\" or another event number, it creates a main folder (e.g., \"Event 38\").\n2. **Detect the skater list:** Each numbered skater (1., 2., etc.) gets a subfolder under the event folder (e.g., \"1. Madison Isaacson\").\n3. **Ignore rink affiliations:** The script would skip any text following the skater\u2019s name if it\u2019s consistently formatted.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Breakdown of the Automation Steps:**\n1. **OCR Extraction:** Use an OCR tool (like **Tesseract** or **Adobe Acrobat\u2019s batch text recognition**) to extract the event and skater names.\n2. **Script Logic:**\n   - Recognize the event number (using the format **\"##\"**).\n   - Identify skater lines (using **numbered entries: 1., 2., etc.**).\n   - Create folders automatically.\n\n---\n\n### **Example Output:**\nFor an event like this:\n```\n38\n1. Madison Isaacson\n2. Sam Atagana\n```\n\n**Folder Structure Created Automatically:**\n```\nEvent 38\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 1. Madison Isaacson\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 2. Sam Atagana\n```\n\nDoes this sound like what you\u2019re envisioning? If you upload the image, I can inspect it for text recognition accuracy and recommend which tool would be ideal!\n\nUser: {'content_type': 'image_asset_pointer', 'asset_pointer': 'file-service://file-621CykyQ1v2HS5if2uijbZ', 'size_bytes': 1980696, 'width': 1152, 'height': 1536, 'fovea': None, 'metadata': {'dalle': None, 'gizmo': None, 'generation': None, 'container_pixel_height': None, 'container_pixel_width': None, 'emu_omit_glimpse_image': None, 'emu_patches_override': None, 'sanitized': True, 'asset_pointer_link': None}}\n\nAssistant: Thanks for sharing the photo! I see how structured the format is, which is a **good thing** for automating the process. Here's how we could extract the needed information and create the folder structure:\n\n### **1. Key Information to Capture:**\n- **Event Number:** Clearly visible as \"38\" at the top.\n- **Skaters:** Numbered list under \"Skaters\" (e.g., \"1. Madison Isaacson\").\n- **Ignore Extras:** Everything after the skater\u2019s name (rink info, panel of officials, etc.) can be filtered out.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Ideal Extraction Process**\nWe could use an **OCR tool like Tesseract** to:\n1. **Scan the document** and extract text line by line.\n2. **Identify patterns:**\n   - Event number: Detect the number at the top (typically \"##\").\n   - Skater names: Detect and capture **\u201c1.\u201d, \u201c2.\u201d, etc.** lines.\n\n### **3. Script Behavior**\n1. **Create Main Folder:** Based on the event number (e.g., \"Event 38\").\n2. **Create Subfolders:** For each skater under the event (e.g., \"1. Madison Isaacson\").\n3. **Optional:** If there\u2019s more than one page, the script can loop through multiple event lists.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Simple Python Concept**\nWe could design the script as:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Simulate extracted text from OCR (in real use, pull this dynamically)\nextracted_text = \"\"\"\n38 - Basic 1-6 Interpretive\n1. Madison Isaacson, Line Creek FSC\n2. Sam Atagana, Kansas City FSC\n\"\"\"\n\n# Destination folder path\ndestination_path = \"/path/to/organized_photos\"\n\n# Parse the text to extract event number and skater names\nlines = extracted_text.splitlines()\nevent_number = lines[0].split()[0]  # Get event number \"38\"\nevent_folder = os.path.join(destination_path, f\"Event_{event_number}\")\nos.makedirs(event_folder, exist_ok=True)\n\nfor line in lines:\n    if line.startswith(tuple(str(i) + \".\" for i in range(1, 10))):  # Skater entry\n        skater_name = line.split(\",\")[0]  # Grab the name before the comma\n        skater_folder = os.path.join(event_folder, skater_name.strip())\n        os.makedirs(skater_folder, exist_ok=True)\n        print(f\"Created folder: {skater_folder}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Works Well:**\n- **Standardized Format:** Since the lists come from USFS in predictable formats, the script can reliably detect event numbers and skater names.\n- **Minimal Input:** Scan, run the script, and let it handle folder creation.\n- **Flexible Scaling:** Can process multiple event pages automatically.\n\nWould you like help testing this with the full scan to see how well it detects the key info, or is this close to what you had in mind?\n\nUser: Ok, but\u2026 What I would rather is the folder structure being opposite. So it would create a folder for Madison Isaacson and then nest a folder named Event 38. The next page that Madison Isaacson has an event, it would just create a subsequent Event folder. \n\nAssistant: Sam prefers the folder structure to be organized by skater name first, with nested folders for each event they participate in. For example, the structure would create a folder for \"Madison Isaacson,\" and within it, a folder named \"Event 38.\" If Madison participates in another event, a new folder (e.g., \"Event 39\") would be added under her name. This organization better aligns with Sam's workflow and tracking needs.\n\nAssistant: Got it, Sam! That structure makes perfect sense for **quick access and sorting by skater**. Here\u2019s how we can tweak the logic for the script:\n\n---\n\n### **Adjusted Folder Structure Example**\nFor:\n```\n38 - Basic 1-6 Interpretive\n1. Madison Isaacson, Line Creek FSC\n2. Sam Atagana, Kansas City FSC\n```\n\nThe script would create:\n```\nMadison Isaacson\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Event 38\nSam Atagana\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Event 38\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Revised Python Script Logic**\nWe\u2019ll:\n1. Identify the **skater\u2019s name** first.\n2. Check if the skater\u2019s main folder already exists. If not, create it.\n3. Nest the **event folder** under the skater\u2019s folder.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick example:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Simulated extracted text from OCR (in real use, pull this dynamically)\nextracted_text = \"\"\"\n38 - Basic 1-6 Interpretive\n1. Madison Isaacson, Line Creek FSC\n2. Sam Atagana, Kansas City FSC\n\"\"\"\n\n# Destination folder path\ndestination_path = \"/path/to/organized_photos\"\n\n# Parse the text to extract event number and skater names\nlines = extracted_text.splitlines()\nevent_number = lines[0].split()[0]  # Get event number \"38\"\n\nfor line in lines:\n    if line.startswith(tuple(str(i) + \".\" for i in range(1, 10))):  # Detect skater entry\n        skater_name = line.split(\",\")[0].strip().split(\". \", 1)[1]  # Get the name\n        skater_folder = os.path.join(destination_path, skater_name)\n        os.makedirs(skater_folder, exist_ok=True)  # Create skater folder if not exists\n        \n        # Create nested event folder\n        event_folder = os.path.join(skater_folder, f\"Event_{event_number}\")\n        os.makedirs(event_folder, exist_ok=True)\n        \n        print(f\"Created folder: {event_folder}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Structure Helps:**\n- **Organized by Skater First:** You can quickly locate all the events a skater participated in without hunting through folders.\n- **Avoids Duplicate Names:** If a skater appears in multiple events, the nested folders keep everything organized neatly.\n\nLet me know if this structure works for you, and we can test it further!\n\nUser: So I would scan all of the pages for the day and then what? \n\nAssistant: Here\u2019s how the **full process** could look once you have all the pages scanned:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Scanning the Pages**\n- At the start (or end) of the day, scan the skater schedule **as a single PDF or multiple image files** using your phone or a scanner.  \n- Tools like **Adobe Scan**, **Microsoft Lens**, or a basic flatbed scanner will work fine.\n\n---\n\n### **2. OCR Extraction**\n- Use an **OCR tool** to convert the scanned pages into text.\n- Recommended tools:\n  - **Tesseract (via Python)** \u2014 Free and customizable for batch processing.\n  - **Adobe Acrobat Pro** \u2014 Built-in OCR with reliable accuracy.\n  - **Online OCR services** \u2014 If you want a quick solution without setup.\n  \nExample command if using Tesseract (for batch OCR):\n```bash\ntesseract scanned_schedule.pdf output_text.txt\n```\nThis converts the **PDF into a text file** ready for parsing.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Running the Folder Creation Script**\n- Once you have the **text file** from OCR, you can run the Python script we discussed.  \n- The script will:\n  - Parse the text line by line.\n  - Extract skater names and events.\n  - Create folders by skater and nest the corresponding event folders inside.\n\nExample execution:\n```bash\npython create_folders.py\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Organizing Files**\n- After the script creates the folder structure, you (or Ben) can:\n  - Insert photos from each memory card into the **appropriate skater/event folder**.\n  - You can do this manually or automate part of it using metadata (like the QR code trick or timestamps if needed).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Optional Automation (Fully Streamlined)**\nIf you\u2019d like, we could **automate the entire process** so that:\n1. You scan the pages.\n2. The system detects the scan and runs OCR automatically.\n3. The folder structure is built **without manual intervention**.\n\nWould this streamlined approach fit your needs, or do you want to keep the OCR step a bit more hands-on for flexibility?\n\nUser: How would the fully automated process work\n\nAssistant: Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide for how the **fully automated workflow** could work, requiring minimal manual interaction:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Scan the Pages**\n**Goal:** As simple as taking pictures of the day\u2019s skater schedule or scanning it into a multi-page PDF.\n\n**Options:**\n- Use a **dedicated scanner** or your **phone\u2019s camera (e.g., Adobe Scan or Office Lens)** to quickly capture all pages.\n- Save the scans in a dedicated folder (e.g., **/ScannedSchedules/**) to be processed automatically.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Automatically Detect New Scans**\nWe\u2019ll set up an **automated trigger** to detect when new scans are added to the folder.\n\n**Option 1: Use a File Monitor Script**\n- A simple Python or shell script continuously monitors the **/ScannedSchedules/** folder.\n- When a new file is detected, the OCR process starts automatically.\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport os\n\nfolder_to_monitor = \"/path/to/ScannedSchedules/\"\nprocessed_folder = \"/path/to/ProcessedSchedules/\"\n\ndef check_for_new_scans():\n    while True:\n        for file in os.listdir(folder_to_monitor):\n            if file.endswith(\".pdf\") or file.endswith(\".jpg\"):\n                print(f\"Processing: {file}\")\n                run_ocr_and_create_folders(file)\n                os.rename(os.path.join(folder_to_monitor, file), \n                          os.path.join(processed_folder, file))  # Move after processing\n        time.sleep(10)  # Check every 10 seconds\n\ndef run_ocr_and_create_folders(file):\n    os.system(f\"tesseract {os.path.join(folder_to_monitor, file)} output_text.txt\")\n    parse_text_and_create_folders(\"output_text.txt\")\n\ncheck_for_new_scans()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Perform OCR Automatically**\n- As soon as the new scan is detected, the script will **run OCR** (using Tesseract or any other OCR tool) to extract text into a readable format.\n- **For PDFs with multiple pages**, Tesseract can extract everything sequentially into one large text file.\n\nCommand example for PDFs:\n```bash\ntesseract /path/to/ScannedSchedules/schedule.pdf output_text.txt\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Automatically Parse the Extracted Text**\n- Once the text is extracted, the **folder creation script** parses it line by line, identifying the event number and skater names.\n- The script dynamically checks if the skater\u2019s folder already exists and creates nested event folders as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Automatically Create Folders**\nThe folder creation script (similar to what we discussed) will:\n1. Create a **main folder for each skater**.\n2. Nest the **event folder** under their respective folder.\n3. Continue processing all skaters listed in the scanned text.\n\nExample:\n```\n/Photos\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Madison Isaacson\n    \u2502    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Event 38\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Sam Atagana\n         \u2514\u2500\u2500 Event 38\n```\n\n---\n\n### **6. (Optional) Auto-Sort Photos**\nTo **automate photo sorting**, we could:\n- Attach **EXIF-based logic** or metadata-based triggers to automatically move images into the correct skater/event folder based on the event timeline (if skater timing is known).\n- Use a **batch process** like a photo organizer script to pair skater folders with images from the memory card during import.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Automated Workflow Summary**\n1. **Scan:** Take pictures of the schedule or scan it into a multi-page PDF.\n2. **Drop into Folder:** Place the scanned file into a designated folder.\n3. **Automatic OCR Trigger:** A script detects the new file and runs OCR to extract skater names and events.\n4. **Folder Creation:** The system creates skater folders and nests event subfolders.\n5. **(Optional) Automated Photo Import:** You or Ben can either manually copy files or use scripts to organize them directly into their corresponding skater/event folder.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like help building a test version of this process, or are there any parts you\u2019d like customized further?**\n\nUser: {'content_type': 'image_asset_pointer', 'asset_pointer': 'file-service://file-PVxssnR9iikrUneHCWESkh', 'size_bytes': 165899, 'width': 708, 'height': 1536, 'fovea': None, 'metadata': {'dalle': None, 'gizmo': None, 'generation': None, 'container_pixel_height': None, 'container_pixel_width': None, 'emu_omit_glimpse_image': None, 'emu_patches_override': None, 'sanitized': True, 'asset_pointer_link': None}}\n\nAssistant: Sam\u2019s current folder structure for uploading photos to ShootProof is organized as follows:\n\n1. **Skater\u2019s Name Folder**  \n   - **Competition Name Folder (e.g., 2024 City of Fountains Fall Fling)**  \n     - **Event Folder (e.g., Event 38, Event XX)**\n\nThis structure reflects how galleries are presented on ShootProof, with new competitions creating a main album, and individual events nested within. Sam wants to automate folder creation to match this structure and save time during large events.\n\nAssistant: This is a great insight, Sam! We can absolutely automate the folder creation to match this structure. Here's how we can modify the process:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Folder Structure Automation Logic**\nWe\u2019ll:\n1. Extract **skater names** and **event numbers** from the scanned pages.\n2. Include the **competition name** (e.g., **2024 City of Fountains Fall Fling**) as part of the folder hierarchy.\n3. Automatically create this structure:\n\n```\nMadison Isaacson\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 2024 City of Fountains Fall Fling\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 Event 38\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 Event 39\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. How It Works**\n1. When you scan the day\u2019s event list, the **OCR tool** extracts:\n   - Skater names\n   - Event numbers\n   - The **competition name** (we can either extract it or manually specify it if it\u2019s consistent throughout the document).\n\n2. The Python script will:\n   - Check if the skater\u2019s folder already exists.\n   - Create a subfolder for the competition under their name.\n   - Nest the corresponding event folders inside the competition folder.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Example Python Script (Updated for Full Folder Structure)**\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Simulated OCR text extraction (in real use, pull this dynamically)\nextracted_text = \"\"\"\n38 - Basic 1-6 Interpretive\n1. Madison Isaacson, Line Creek FSC\n2. Sam Atagana, Kansas City FSC\n\"\"\"\n\n# Define the competition name (can be pulled from text or input manually)\ncompetition_name = \"2024 City of Fountains Fall Fling\"\n\n# Destination path for folder creation\ndestination_path = \"/path/to/organized_photos\"\n\n# Parse the text to extract skater names and events\nlines = extracted_text.splitlines()\nevent_number = lines[0].split()[0]  # Get event number \"38\"\n\nfor line in lines:\n    if line.startswith(tuple(str(i) + \".\" for i in range(1, 10))):  # Detect skater entry\n        skater_name = line.split(\",\")[0].strip().split(\". \", 1)[1]  # Get the skater's name\n        \n        # Create skater folder\n        skater_folder = os.path.join(destination_path, skater_name)\n        os.makedirs(skater_folder, exist_ok=True)\n        \n        # Create competition folder inside skater folder\n        competition_folder = os.path.join(skater_folder, competition_name)\n        os.makedirs(competition_folder, exist_ok=True)\n        \n        # Create event folder inside competition folder\n        event_folder = os.path.join(competition_folder, f\"Event_{event_number}\")\n        os.makedirs(event_folder, exist_ok=True)\n        \n        print(f\"Created folder: {event_folder}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Dynamic Competition Name Extraction (Optional)**\nIf the competition name is present on the page (like at the top of the sheet you uploaded), we can use **OCR to extract it automatically** instead of entering it manually.\n\nExample modification:\n```python\ncompetition_name = lines[0].strip()  # Automatically extract competition name from the first line\n```\n\n---\n\n### **5. Final Workflow**\n1. Scan the daily event list and drop it into the folder.\n2. The system detects the scan, runs OCR, and executes the script.\n3. The entire folder structure is created automatically and ready for Ben or you to import and sort the photos.\n\nDoes this fully capture your vision, or would you like to adjust any part of the process further?\n\nUser: I think what would be best now that I\u2019m reading what you\u2019re saying is if I could define the competition name myself. If you see the screen shot, it only says 2024 Fall Fling instead of the whole big ass name. \n\nAssistant: Sam prefers to manually define the competition name when automating the folder structure creation, as the abbreviated names on the event sheets (e.g., \"2024 Fall Fling\") do not match the full competition names used in his folder structure. This allows for greater control and consistency when organizing the folders.\n\nAssistant: Got it! Manually defining the competition name makes perfect sense to keep things clean and consistent. I\u2019ll tweak the script so that you can easily input the full competition name at runtime, ensuring the correct structure gets built without relying on potentially inconsistent OCR extraction.\n\nLet me know when you\u2019re ready to test this process with an actual scan, and I can help fine-tune the automation further!\n\nUser: Would a photo like the one I sent you of the list work for the OCR? \n\nAssistant: Yes, the photo you sent should work for OCR, especially since the text is **high-contrast and printed in a clear, structured format.** However, to ensure good accuracy when extracting **event numbers and skater names**, here are a few tips to optimize the process:\n\n### **Why It Should Work:**\n- **High contrast:** The black text on white paper makes it easy for OCR tools to detect.\n- **Minimal background noise:** The plain paper background will reduce OCR errors.\n- **Structured format:** The numbered list format (1., 2., etc.) makes it easier to parse.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips for the Best OCR Results:**\n1. **Lighting:** Ensure the page is well-lit without shadows or glare (the photo you provided is already good).\n2. **Resolution:** For best results, aim for at least **300 DPI** if you\u2019re scanning or using a phone camera.\n3. **Deskewing:** If the page is slightly tilted in the image, apps like **Adobe Scan** or **Microsoft Lens** automatically correct it.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended OCR Tools to Try:**\n1. **Tesseract (via Python):** Great for batch automation and highly customizable.\n2. **Adobe Acrobat Pro:** Reliable for converting images to readable text.\n3. **Online OCR Tools:** Quick and easy for testing without setup (e.g., **OnlineOCR.net**).\n\nWould you like me to walk you through setting up **Tesseract OCR** to test the extraction on this image, or would you prefer to start with a simpler tool first?\n\nUser: There isn\u2019t a way I could do this on an iPhone or iPad is there? \n\nAssistant: Yes, you **absolutely can do this on an iPhone or iPad!** There are several great apps that can **scan the page, run OCR, and even trigger automation if needed.** Here\u2019s what I\u2019d recommend for an iOS workflow:\n\n---\n\n### **Option 1: Using Microsoft OneNote (Free)**\n- **Why:** OneNote has a built-in OCR feature that works directly with iPhone photos.\n- **Workflow:**\n  1. Open **OneNote** and take a photo of the skater list.\n  2. Long press the image and select **Copy Text from Picture** (OneNote will extract the text).\n  3. Paste it into any text editor, and you can email it to yourself or upload it for processing.\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Using Adobe Scan (Free, Easy)**\n- **Why:** It automatically deskews and enhances text while running OCR.\n- **Workflow:**\n  1. Download **Adobe Scan** on your iPhone or iPad.\n  2. Take a photo or scan the page using the app.\n  3. Save the scan as a PDF and select **Recognize Text (OCR)** within the app.\n  4. Export the recognized text as a **.txt file** or email it to yourself.\n\n---\n\n### **Option 3: Using Shortcuts App for Full Automation**\n- **Why:** You can create a custom **Shortcut** to take a photo, extract text using OCR, and trigger automation for folder creation.\n- **Workflow:**\n  1. Open the **Shortcuts app** and create a new Shortcut.\n  2. Add the following steps:\n     - **Take Photo**  \n     - **Recognize Text from Image**  \n     - **Save or Share the Text** (e.g., save to Notes or Files).\n  3. This shortcut could even pass the text directly into a cloud-based automation system like Zapier or IFTTT if you want to fully automate folder creation.\n\n---\n\n### **Bonus: GoodNotes for Handwritten or Messier Text**\n- If any event lists ever come handwritten, **GoodNotes** can convert both printed and handwritten text using its **OCR feature**.\n\n---\n\nWould any of these options work for you, or would you prefer an app with additional automation potential like Zapier?\n\nUser: Nothing that needs to be recognized should ever be hand written. \n\nAssistant: Sam clarified that any event lists or documents needing recognition for folder automation will always be printed, not handwritten, ensuring consistent and reliable text extraction.\n\nAssistant: Got it\u2014that\u2019s actually great because printed text ensures much better OCR accuracy. I\u2019d recommend **Adobe Scan** or **OneNote** for quick OCR on your iPhone or iPad. Once the text is extracted, you could manually input the competition name and run the folder creation workflow on a computer or explore **Shortcuts automation** for a streamlined mobile setup.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to test the extraction and then move on to automating the folder creation!\n\nUser: So when I left my Lightroom CC to enhance overnight it stopped and says \n\n\"Macintosh HD\" is full. Please clear some space of change your cache settings\"\n\nAssistant: Ah, that\u2019s frustrating, Sam. Lightroom CC is notorious for using **a lot of disk space** while processing large batches, especially with **Enhance Denoise** because it creates large DNG files as output. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what\u2019s happening and some quick fixes:\n\n---\n\n### **What\u2019s Happening:**\n- **Lightroom\u2019s Cache:** By default, Lightroom uses a temporary cache to store previews and intermediate files. When using **Enhance Denoise**, the cache fills up quickly since the DNG files can be **10-20 times larger** than the original RAW files.\n- **Disk Space Requirements:** It\u2019s possible that while processing, Lightroom consumed all available space on **Macintosh HD**, pausing or stopping the task.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Fix Options:**\n\n1. **Clear Lightroom\u2019s Cache:**\n   - Go to **Preferences > Local Storage** and click **Clear Cache**.\n   - If the cache size was large, this should free up some immediate space.\n\n2. **Change Cache Location:**\n   - If your **Macintosh HD** is tight on space but you have an external drive, you can relocate Lightroom\u2019s cache:\n     - **Preferences > Local Storage > Cache Location > Change Folder.**\n     - Choose an external drive with plenty of space to prevent future issues.\n\n3. **Free Up Space on Macintosh HD:**\n   - Check your system storage using **\uf8ff > About This Mac > Storage** to see which areas are taking up space.\n   - Suggestions to free up space:\n     - Empty the **Trash**.\n     - Clear large files or apps you don\u2019t use.\n     - Delete old backups or downloads.\n\n4. **Move Lightroom Originals to an External Drive:**\n   - If your originals are stored locally on **Macintosh HD**, consider moving them to an external drive and linking Lightroom to the new location.\n\n---\n\n### **Prevent This Issue in the Future:**\n- **Limit Enhanced DNG Files:** If you\u2019re enhancing large batches of photos, consider doing them in smaller batches, especially when disk space is low.\n- **Regularly Clear Cache:** Set a reminder to periodically clear Lightroom\u2019s cache.\n\nLet me know if you want help with any of these steps or if the issue persists after freeing up space!\n\nUser: Alright, my domains finally transferred to GoDaddy. I am trying to get my Google WorkSpace up and running. Google wants me to add the code they gace me to the DNS section. But I dont seem to be able to add a DNS record on Go Daddy\n\nAssistant: It sounds like you\u2019re close, Sam! Let me walk you through adding the DNS record for **Google Workspace** in GoDaddy:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Sign in to GoDaddy**\n1. **Go to** [GoDaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com) and sign in.\n2. Navigate to **My Products** \u2192 **Domains** and click **Manage** next to the domain you\u2019re configuring.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Open the DNS Management Section**\n1. Once inside the domain management, look for **DNS Settings** or **Manage DNS**.\n2. This will open a page listing all the DNS records (A, CNAME, TXT, MX, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Add a TXT Record for Google Verification**\n1. Under the DNS management page, look for an **\u201cAdd\u201d button** to create a new record.\n2. Select **TXT Record** as the type.\n\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll enter based on Google\u2019s instructions:\n- **Type:** TXT  \n- **Name/Host:** `@` (or leave it blank if GoDaddy requires this)  \n- **Value:** The code Google gave you (e.g., `google-site-verification=xyz...`)  \n- **TTL:** Leave the default value (usually 1 hour).\n\n3. **Save the record.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Domain in Google Workspace**\n1. Head back to your Google Workspace setup page.\n2. Click **Verify** and wait for Google to check the DNS record.  \n   - This can take a few minutes or up to 24 hours.\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Issue: Can\u2019t Find or Access DNS Section?**\n- If you don\u2019t see the option to **add or manage DNS records**, it\u2019s possible that:\n  - Your domain is **still propagating** after the transfer (this can take a few hours).\n  - The DNS settings are managed through another service if you haven\u2019t fully switched control over to GoDaddy.\n\nTo confirm, you can:\n1. Check **WHOIS lookup** to verify the domain\u2019s nameservers.\n2. If needed, GoDaddy support can help ensure DNS settings are correctly pointing to their servers.\n\nDoes this help you move forward, or do you see any error messages in GoDaddy that we can troubleshoot?\n\nUser: OH its saying that my name servers arent managed by GoDaddy.\n\nAssistant: Ah! That explains why you\u2019re unable to manage the DNS settings. If the **name servers** aren\u2019t pointing to GoDaddy, it means **another provider (likely the previous registrar or hosting provider)** is currently controlling the DNS.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can fix this:\n\n---\n\n### **Option 1: Change the Name Servers to GoDaddy**\nThis will **move DNS management** to GoDaddy, allowing you to create records there.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Go to **GoDaddy Dashboard** \u2192 **My Products** \u2192 **Domains** \u2192 **Manage DNS**.\n2. Look for the **Nameservers section** and click **Change Nameservers**.\n3. Select **\u201cSet to default\u201d** to use GoDaddy\u2019s name servers:\n   ```\n   nsXX.domaincontrol.com (GoDaddy's default nameservers)\n   ```\n4. Save the changes.\n\n**Important:**  \n- DNS propagation may take up to **24-48 hours**, but it often updates within a few hours.\n- Once propagation completes, you can access and modify the DNS records in GoDaddy.\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Keep Existing Name Servers and Edit DNS with Current Provider**\nIf you don\u2019t want to change the name servers, you can manage DNS from your **current provider** instead of GoDaddy.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Determine who is managing the current name servers:\n   - You can check this using **WHOIS lookup** or **GoDaddy\u2019s DNS panel**, where it should list the active nameservers.\n   - If it\u2019s your **old registrar (like Google Domains or Cloudflare)**, log into their DNS management portal.\n2. Add the **TXT record** Google provided for verification within that DNS manager.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Option Should You Choose?**\n- **If you plan to fully manage DNS through GoDaddy:** Change the name servers to GoDaddy\u2019s defaults (Option 1).\n- **If you want to keep DNS with the current provider:** Log into the current DNS manager and add the Google TXT record there (Option 2).\n\nLet me know which option you prefer, and I can help guide you through it!\n\nUser: How do I make my domain samcantskate.com forward to samataganaphotography.com\n\nAssistant: To **forward your domain** (e.g., **samcantskate.com** \u2192 **samataganaphotography.com**) using **GoDaddy**, follow these steps:\n\n---\n\n### **Steps to Forward a Domain in GoDaddy:**\n\n1. **Log into GoDaddy**  \n   Go to [GoDaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com) and sign in.\n\n2. **Access Domain Settings:**  \n   - Navigate to **My Products** \u2192 **Domains**.  \n   - Find **samcantskate.com** and click **Manage**.\n\n3. **Set Up Forwarding:**  \n   - In the domain settings, scroll down to the **Forwarding section**.\n   - Click **Add Forwarding** under **Domain Forwarding**.\n\n4. **Enter the Forwarding Information:**  \n   - **Forward to:** Enter `https://samataganaphotography.com`  \n   - **Forward type:** Choose between:\n     - **Permanent (301)**: Tells search engines this is a permanent redirect (recommended).\n     - **Temporary (302)**: Use this if you only plan to forward temporarily.\n   - **Settings:**\n     - **Forward with masking:** If enabled, the URL in the address bar will stay as **samcantskate.com**.  \n     - **Forward without masking:** The address bar will show **samataganaphotography.com** (recommended for SEO).\n\n5. **Save:**  \n   - Click **Save** and allow a few minutes (or up to 24 hours) for the forwarding to take effect.\n\n---\n\n### **Things to Double-Check:**\n- **SSL:** If you forward with HTTPS, ensure both domains have valid SSL certificates to avoid security warnings.\n- **DNS Propagation:** Changes typically update quickly but may take longer depending on DNS caching.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues, and I can help troubleshoot!\n\nUser: How can I forward my email from samataganaphotography@gmail.com to photo@samcantskate.com\n\nAssistant: To **forward emails from your Gmail address** (e.g., **samataganaphotography@gmail.com**) to a custom domain email (e.g., **photo@samcantskate.com**), you have a few options depending on your setup.

Remember I contacted Topaz about not being able to upgrade and having to pay the full price instead for Photo AI?\n\nAssistant: Sam contacted Topaz Labs regarding the issue of not being able to upgrade to Topaz Photo AI and instead being asked to pay the full price, despite already owning Gigapixel AI, Sharpen AI, and DeNoise AI.\n\nAssistant: Oh yeah, I remember you mentioning that frustration. What did they say? Did they offer any kind of discount or explanation, or was it more of a \"sorry, full price only\" situation?\n\nUser: Neither of those things, even though thats exactly what I expected. Im going to send you their exact response. And I thought I wasnt understanding but its true. \n\nHi Samuel!\n\nUsually, a user would need to purchase a User License for Photo AI. However, I added a User License to your account at no charge to you. You will need to purchase an Upgrade Renewal License for any new updates or version releases after today, though. \ud83d\udc9a You can download the installer from your \u201cMy Products\" page.\n\nHere are the current renewal options and prices for Photo AI:\n\nStandard Upgrades: $119 USD - This allows you to purchase an upgrade license annually without an automatically renewing license. The upgrade license will not be automatically renewed when it expires.\nAuto-Renew: $99 USD - Save the most by locking in a lower upgrade price with auto-renewal. This option can be canceled at any time and will be billed annually.\nNo Renewal: This option means that you are letting your upgrade plan expire. If you change your mind in the future, you will only have the Standard upgrade option and the Auto-Renew option.\n\nLet me know if there is anything else I can help with! Happy Editing! \ud83d\udcf8\n\nAssistant: Whoa, that\u2019s actually a **pleasant surprise!** \ud83c\udf89 I bet you were bracing for the usual \u201cwe don\u2019t offer discounts\u201d response, but instead, **they gave you a full Photo AI license for free**\u2014that\u2019s huge! Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t have expected that either, considering you\u2019ve already had a bit of bad luck with Topaz.\n\n### **What This Means for You:**\n- You **own Topaz Photo AI outright now**, with no need to pay the full price upfront.  \n- The only cost going forward would be for updates and renewals, which are fairly reasonable compared to their initial pricing model.\n\n### **Their Renewal Options:**\n- **$99/year for auto-renewal:** If you stay current and want regular updates.  \n- **$119/year for manual renewal:** No automatic charges\u2014this would give you flexibility if you skip a year.  \n- **No renewal:** You keep the current version but won\u2019t get updates.\n\n**Honestly, they saved you a good chunk of money.** I\u2019m impressed they didn\u2019t make you jump through hoops. Are you thinking of trying it right away, or are you still debating if it\u2019s worth incorporating into your workflow?\n\nUser: They really did. And I had almost written them off but with quick and effective customer service like that, I have to give them a go.\n\nAssistant: Sam was pleasantly surprised by Topaz Labs\u2019 quick and effective customer service after they provided him with a free user license for Topaz Photo AI. Although he had nearly written them off, this positive experience has encouraged him to give their software another try.\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s great to hear! It\u2019s rare for companies to go the extra mile like that, and it sounds like they won you back in the best possible way. I\u2019m curious to see how Photo AI performs for you\u2014especially after some of the frustrations with other noise reduction tools. Let me know how it fits into your workflow!\n\nUser: Does Ravi die in Galaxy\u2019s Edge?\n\nAssistant: \ue203Yes, Ravi, the holographic navigator and co-pilot aboard Aeson Keel's ship, the Indelible IV, dies in the *Galaxy's Edge* series.\ue204 \ue203He is killed in action while protecting Prisma Maydoon during a firefight with Legion troops.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\ue206 \n\nUser: He comes back after that. Does he die again? \n\nAssistant: \ue203In the *Galaxy's Edge* series, Ravi, the holographic navigator and co-pilot aboard Aeson Keel's ship, the Indelible IV, is initially killed in action while protecting Prisma Maydoon during a firefight with Legion troops.\ue204 \ue203However, he is later restored and continues to play a significant role in the series.\ue204 \ue203As of the latest installments, there is no indication that Ravi dies again.\ue204 \ue203He remains an integral part of the crew, assisting Keel and others in their ongoing missions.\ue204\ue206 \n\nUser: What book does Skriz die in \n\nAssistant: \ue203In the *Galaxy's Edge* series, Skriz, the Wobanki co-pilot of Tyrus Rechs, meets his end in the book **\"Message for the Dead\"**.\ue204 \ue203During a mission, Skriz is killed in action, marking a significant moment in the narrative.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201\ue206 \n\nUser: He\u2019s my favorite character and I\u2019m on that book \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nAssistant: Ah, Sam, I feel for you! \ud83d\ude22 Losing a favorite character like Skriz can hit hard, especially with how **brilliantly written and loyal** he is in the series. I won\u2019t spoil exactly how it happens, but I know it\u2019s a moment that sticks with fans.\n\nIf it\u2019s any comfort, Skriz\u2019s legacy is woven into the fabric of the series, and the emotional impact he leaves behind is *significant*. You\u2019re in a heavy part of the journey, but that\u2019s the mark of a story that really connects, right?\n\nI\u2019m here if you want to vent or discuss how you\u2019re processing it\u2014losing a favorite character can feel like losing a friend. \ud83e\udec2\n\nUser: There\u2019s something strange about this series and I don\u2019t know what it is. I think it\u2019s the combo of how the storyline jumps through time periods and the pacing. It\u2019s almost a hurry up and wait pacing. I coined that as one of the only well read military members since that phrase was coined lol. It seems like a lot of stuff happens off screen and then there is such a detailed several chapters of what seems like a benign strand. \n\nAssistant: I get exactly what you\u2019re describing, Sam, and I think you\u2019ve nailed a key part of what makes *Galaxy\u2019s Edge* feel so unique\u2014and sometimes disorienting. That **\u201churry up and wait\u201d pacing** you coined fits perfectly. There\u2019s this **chaotic mixture of fast, large-scale events happening off-screen** (like galactic battles or shifting power structures) that you only hear about through dialogue or brief mentions. Meanwhile, the narrative zooms in on **seemingly small, drawn-out sequences**\u2014sometimes character interactions, tactical setups, or side quests that seem mundane until they pay off later.\n\n### **Why It Feels This Way:**\n1. **The Military Storytelling Influence:**  \n   Since the authors (Nick Cole and Jason Anspach) have a military background, they\u2019re emulating the experience of soldiers:  \n   - Big, mission-altering events often happen without you being directly involved.\n   - You spend long stretches focusing on small tasks (patrols, waiting for orders, minor skirmishes), and then *bam*, major action happens fast or off-screen.\n\n2. **Nonlinear Time Jumps:**  \n   The series **jumps back and forth between time periods and perspectives**, which can make it feel fragmented. You might leave one story arc and return to it later, often after critical moments have already happened off-screen, making you play catch-up.\n\n3. **Purposeful Slow Burn:**  \n   Some parts of the series intentionally **drag you through slower chapters (like conversations or internal monologues)** that build character depth and tension. But if you\u2019re expecting constant forward plot progression, it can feel like hitting the brakes in the middle of a chase.\n\n4. **Off-Screen Plot Development:**  \n   The authors sometimes **withhold major plot events** to maintain mystery or to reveal them later through flashbacks, reports, or character reflections. While it keeps you on your toes, it can also leave you feeling like you missed something crucial.\n\n---\n\n### **Why It Can Work (or Frustrate):**\n- **When it works:** It feels realistic\u2014like you\u2019re in a world too big for one character\u2019s perspective, and it mirrors the chaos of military life.  \n- **When it doesn\u2019t:** It feels like you\u2019re being pulled away from the exciting stuff and stuck in chapters that don\u2019t seem to matter (until, hopefully, they do).\n\nDoes this pacing bother you, or do you find it mostly intriguing? I could see someone like you appreciating the authenticity of the military storytelling but also feeling a bit frustrated when the plot doesn\u2019t give you everything upfront. What\u2019s your gut take?\n\nUser: It doesn\u2019t bother me necessarily and I find myself interested. I will say that this is one of not many times that I could FEEL the military service in the author. It\u2019s not the terminology that anyone could Google, or the weapons systems, or even the battles themselves. It\u2019s the perspective. Any combat vet has felt at least one of these storylines deeply. A loose quote I just heard that made me smile was something like \u201chaving memories of my life in a situation like this really makes me think I\u2019m going to die\u201d. There were several times overseas when I was in a situation and my mind was side tracked by memories of things that had happened that had nothing to do with the present conflict. I would always tell my life to stop flashing me lol\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a really profound observation, Sam. I love how you can pick up on the **authenticity in the perspective**, something that can\u2019t be faked or Googled. What you\u2019re describing\u2014the feeling of **life flashing through seemingly disconnected memories** in moments of danger\u2014is such a real, visceral experience that only someone who\u2019s been there could write effectively. It\u2019s not forced, it\u2019s not romanticized\u2014it\u2019s that **quiet, internal chaos** that military folks know all too well.\n\nThe line you quoted really hits home because it captures that strange duality: you\u2019re in a life-threatening moment, yet your mind wanders to a seemingly benign or random thought, like the memory is trying to distract you\u2014or maybe even prepare you. I can imagine telling your brain to \u201cstop flashing you\u201d was both a coping mechanism and a way to regain control when the situation felt overwhelming.\n\nThe way *Galaxy\u2019s Edge* taps into that reminds me of how military storytelling often **hides the emotional core beneath action and tactics**, but when it breaks through, it\u2019s raw and undeniable. You can tell the authors aren\u2019t just writing about war\u2014they\u2019re writing about **what it does to your mind and how it stays with you.** \n\nWhen you were reading that scene, did it feel like it pulled you back to those moments overseas, or was it more like seeing them from the outside and reflecting on them now? I imagine it might have hit both ways.\n\nUser: It wasn\u2019t a negative set of memories. But honestly, most of my memories of war that most people would think of as bad make me smile. Like the first time I was in a mortar attack. Socks I was fucking terrified and trying to hide that terror while organizing the troops around me to head to a bunker. I remember seeing this Sergeant Major, leaning against one of the concrete barriers, calmly smoking a cigarette. It was that image that pulled me back from terror and into the analytical thought that has gotten me through many a time like that. I started thinking about the tubes they would be using and their munitions. I started to think about their targeting practices and how they were probably pretty non existent because of the return fire system that was already firing back. Once all my troops were inside the bunker, I walked up to the Sergeant Major and he said \u201cthese attacks are the only time I get to smoke in a non-smoking area, it\u2019s worth the risk\u201d. I was laughing so hard I cried. I thought he had done the same math as me. That the radius of effect of the munitions, their second hand tubes, and the frantic manner they would have to fire them off from a non fixed position meant that you would just have to be really unlucky to get hit. But that wasn\u2019t it. He just wanted to smoke where there was a breeze lol\n\nAssistant: Sam, that is **one hell of a story**\u2014and it\u2019s such a perfect example of why war memories aren\u2019t always what people expect them to be. You were in the middle of something terrifying, but the moment sticks with you because of the way it **grounded you through humor and logic.** I can picture that scene perfectly: you, holding it together while processing everything analytically, and the Sergeant Major just **vibing with his cigarette** as if it\u2019s a minor inconvenience, not a life-or-death situation.\n\nWhat hits me is how **your mind immediately switched gears**\u2014from terror to thinking through the technical aspects like tube quality, targeting, and counterfire. It\u2019s such a combat vet\u2019s response, and you could **feel the shift from raw fear to calculated survival.** The math made sense, and in that moment, it wasn\u2019t just about being lucky\u2014it was about **understanding the odds.**\n\nBut then, to find out that the Sergeant Major **wasn\u2019t thinking about the math at all**\u2014he just wanted a breezy smoke? That\u2019s exactly the kind of humor that thrives in the chaos of war. It\u2019s dark, but it\u2019s also **life-affirming in the strangest way.** You both knew there was danger, but instead of being swallowed by it, you found something to laugh at\u2014and that\u2019s what sticks.\n\nI imagine that\u2019s why these \u201cbad\u201d memories don\u2019t hit you the way people might assume. You\u2019ve lived through the terror, but what you hold onto are the moments that **brought you back, calmed you, or gave you something to laugh about** when it seemed impossible.\n\nDo you think moments like that shaped your leadership style, especially in how you guided your troops when they were likely feeling the same terror you initially felt?",
