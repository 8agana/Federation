DOes OpenAI run on you?\n\nAssistant: Yes\u2014Microsoft Copilot relies heavily on OpenAI's GPT models. Specifically:\n\n- **Microsoft 365 Copilot** integrates GPT-4 (and increasingly GPT-4o) for productivity tasks like summarization, document creation, and email drafting.\n- **GitHub Copilot** is built primarily around GPT-4 and GPT-4o, optimized for coding and software development.\n- **Windows Copilot** leverages GPT models to manage system-wide commands and queries.\n\nEssentially, Copilot products are Microsoft's branded implementations of OpenAI's latest GPT tech, tightly integrated into Microsoft\u2019s own ecosystem.\n\nFeel free to sarcastically note this as Microsoft\u2019s method of outsourcing innovation\u2014but hey, if it works, it works.\n\nUser: So are their context windows based on the model of GPT thats being used? Either 168k or 200k?\n\nAssistant: \ue203Yes, the context window in Microsoft Copilot products is primarily determined by the underlying OpenAI model in use.\ue204 Here's a concise breakdown:\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Microsoft 365 Copilot\n\n- **Model**: \ue203Primarily utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4.\ue204\n- **Context Window**: \ue203Up to **128,000 tokens** with GPT-4 Turbo.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n- **Practical Considerations**: \ue203While the model supports large context windows, actual usable context may be less due to system prompts and integration with Microsoft Graph data.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 GitHub Copilot\n\n- **Model**: \ue203Employs GPT-4o.\ue204\n- **Context Window**:\n  - **Standard**: \ue203Up to **64,000 tokens** across GitHub.com, GitHub Mobile, GitHub CLI, and supported IDEs.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n  - **Enhanced**: \ue203Up to **128,000 tokens** when using Visual Studio Code Insiders.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Copilot Studio (Custom Agents)\n\n- **Model**: \ue203Varies based on configuration.\ue204\n- **Context Window**: \ue203Specific limits aren't publicly detailed, but practical constraints exist:\n  - **Agent Instructions**: \ue203Limited to **8,000 characters**.\ue204\n  - **File Uploads**: \ue203Supports up to **512 MB** per file, with a maximum of **500 files**.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: \ue203Microsoft Copilot's context window sizes are aligned with the capabilities of the underlying OpenAI models.\ue204 \ue203While models like GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o support large context windows (up to 128,000 tokens), actual usable context may be affected by system-level integrations and prompts.\ue204\ue206 \n\nUser: what is a good work that is the opposite of brilliance\n\nAssistant: A solid antonym for *brilliance*\u2014in the intellectual or creative sense\u2014is **mediocrity**.  \n\nIf you're leaning more toward the light/brightness angle, **dullness** or **dimness** works.\n\nBut if you're feeling poetic or savage, **banality**, **obscurity**, or **ineptitude** sharpen the blade a bit more.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tone you\u2019re aiming for\u2014clinical, cutting, or comically dismissive?\n\nUser: How about a word that starts with br or b that means ineptitude\n\nAssistant: Here are some \u201cbr\u201d or \u201cb\u201d-starting words that orbit ineptitude, depending on tone:\n\n### Starts with **br**:\n- **Brainless** \u2013 colloquial, biting, and blunt.\n- **Bungling** \u2013 clumsy, inept in action; carries a useful \u201cincompetent effort\u201d vibe.\n- **Broken** \u2013 metaphorical, especially for systems or thinking; implies dysfunction rather than stupidity.\n\n### Starts with **b** (not \u201cbr\u201d but close enough):\n- **Buffoonery** \u2013 implies foolish or clownish ineptitude.\n- **Blundering** \u2013 active incompetence, often well-intentioned but wrongheaded.\n- **Boorish** \u2013 less about skill, more about tactless, crude behavior\u2014but overlaps when ineptitude is social.\n\nNone of these are perfect synonyms, but *bungling* and *brainless* probably hit closest if you're looking for a concise counterweight to *brilliance*. Want it for a tagline or a roast?\n\nUser: Im talking to CoPilot and they asked if LLMs every surprise me and I said:\n\nI am constantly surprised by both the brilliance and the blundering of all of the LLMs\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s clean, sharp, and balanced. *Brilliance and blundering* nails the contrast\u2014intellectual highs paired with faceplant lows. Alliteration gives it bite without sounding bitter.\n\nIf you ever want to turn that into a motto:  \n**\u201cExpect brilliance. Prepare for blundering.\u201d**\n\nDid they respond with anything worth mocking?\n\nUser: Expect Exceptionalism. Prepare for P...\n\nAssistant: **Expect Exceptionalism. Prepare for Pandemonium.**\n\nOr if you're aiming for the inept angle:\n\n- **Prepare for Palpable Panic**\n- **Prepare for Pretzel Logic**\n- **Prepare for Perplexity**\n- **Prepare for Programming Purgatory**\n- **Prepare for Predictable Paradox**\n- **Prepare for Parroted Pablum**\n- **Prepare for Premature Confusion**\n\nWant something more deadpan or deranged?\n\nUser: or Parody?\n\nAssistant: **Parody** works beautifully\u2014elegant, sardonic, and meta. Implies the model *thinks* it\u2019s being profound while actually mimicking depth.\n\n**Expect Exceptionalism. Prepare for Parody.**  \nReads like the LLM user's creed.  \nClean. Layered. Vicious in its restraint.\n\nYou want to run with that one, or sharpen it even more?\n\nUser: What is a good tagline for CoPilot? The vibe is something like - the cousin that you follow on Facebook but have no idea what they do for a living\n\nAssistant: Here you go:\n\n**CoPilot: Like your cousin in tech\u2014always posting, never explaining.**\n\nOr:\n\n**CoPilot: Seems smart. Still no clue what it actually does.**\n\nIf you want something punchier:\n\n- **CoPilot: Helpful-ish. Vaguely employed.**\n- **CoPilot: Your AI cousin with mysterious LinkedIn endorsements.**\n- **CoPilot: Posts updates. Doesn\u2019t do dishes.**\n\nWant it snarkier, more corporate, or both?\n\nUser: No more like, the cousin you here about but have never met\n\nAssistant: Ah, got it\u2014mysterious, distant, somehow relevant:\n\n- **CoPilot: The cousin you\u2019ve heard about but never actually met.**\n- **CoPilot: Famously helpful. Allegedly.**\n- **CoPilot: Always mentioned, never explained.**\n- **CoPilot: Like that cousin in consulting\u2014real, probably.**\n- **CoPilot: You\u2019ve heard the name. You\u2019re still not sure what it does.**\n\nWant one that leans more eerie, corporate, or self-aware?\n\nUser: So not mysterious but unremarkable due to mundanity. Is there a better way to say that\n\nAssistant: Yes\u2014what you're describing is *unseen due to utter normalcy*, not intrigue. It\u2019s the kind of presence that fades into the background because it lacks distinction. A few ways to phrase that:\n\n- **Unmemorable by nature.**\n- **Remarkably unremarkable.**\n- **Inconspicuous through banality.**\n- **Too mundane to question.**\n- **Present, but never prominent.**\n- **Functional wallpaper.**\n- **Always mentioned, never interesting.**\n\nApplied as a tagline:\n\n- **CoPilot: Always there. Rarely noticed.**\n- **CoPilot: Like background noise with a Microsoft badge.**\n- **CoPilot: Practically part of the furniture.**\n\nYou want more with that flavor\u2014dry, muted, low-glow forgettability?\n\nUser: Are their any Chromebook Plus laptops that are up for the task of photo editing using Lightroom?\n\nAssistant: \ue203Yes, several **Chromebook Plus** models are capable of handling photo editing tasks in **Adobe Lightroom**.\ue204 \ue203These devices meet Google's enhanced hardware standards, including at least an Intel Core i3 12th Gen or AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series CPU, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, ensuring smooth performance for creative applications\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\ue206\n\n\ue203While **Lightroom Classic** isn't available on ChromeOS, you can use **Lightroom CC** via the Android app or web version.\ue204 \ue203These versions support essential editing features like exposure adjustments, cropping, and filters, suitable for most photo editing needs\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201.\ue206\n\n\ue200products\ue202{\"selections\":[[\"turn0product9\",\"Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714\"],[\"turn0product2\",\"HP Chromebook Plus x360 14c\"],[\"turn0product7\",\"Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook Plus\"]],\"tags\":[\"Best for Performance\",\"Versatile 2-in-1\",\"Budget-Friendly\"]}\ue201\n\n**Top Picks:**\n\n1. **\ue200product_entity\ue202[\"turn0product9\",\"Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714\"]\ue201**  \n   *Best for Performance*  \n   Features an Intel Core Ultra 5 processor, 16GB RAM, and a 14\" WUXGA touchscreen.

need more detailed comparisons or information on other models.\ue206 \n\nUser: So you cant get Lightroom Desktop for Chromebook?\n\nAssistant: \ue200i\ue202turn0image0\ue202turn0image1\ue202turn0image2\ue201\ue203No, you cannot install **Lightroom Classic** or the full **Lightroom Desktop** application on a Chromebook.\ue204 \ue203Chromebooks are designed to run ChromeOS, which doesn't support traditional desktop applications built for Windows or macOS.\ue204\ue206\n\nHowever, you can use **Lightroom CC** on a Chromebook through the following methods:\n\n### 1. **Lightroom Web**\n\ue203Access the web-based version of Lightroom by navigating to [lightroom.adobe.com](https://lightroom.adobe.com) using the Chrome browser on your Chromebook.\ue204 \ue203This version allows you to perform basic photo edits, organize your images, and sync with Adobe's cloud services.\ue204 \ue203While it doesn't offer the full feature set of Lightroom Classic, it's suitable for standard photo editing tasks.\ue204\ue206\n\n### 2. **Lightroom Mobile App**\n\ue203If your Chromebook supports Android apps (most modern Chromebooks do), you can install the Lightroom Mobile app from the Google Play Store.\ue204 \ue203This app provides a more touch-optimized interface and includes features like presets, cropping, and basic adjustments.\ue204 \ue203Keep in mind that some advanced features may require a Creative Cloud subscription.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Limitations to Consider:**\n- **Performance Constraints:** \ue203Chromebooks generally have less powerful hardware compared to traditional laptops, which might affect performance when editing high-resolution images.\ue204\n- **Feature Set:** \ue203Both the web and mobile versions of Lightroom lack some advanced features found in Lightroom Classic, such as detailed color grading, advanced masking, and certain export options.\ue204\n- **RAW File Support:** \ue203While Lightroom Mobile and Web can handle RAW files, the performance may vary depending on the size of the files and the capabilities of your Chromebook.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Workarounds:**\n\ue203Some users have explored using Linux (via Crostini) or emulation tools like Wine to run Lightroom Classic on a Chromebook.\ue204 \ue203However, these methods are complex, often unstable, and generally not recommended for consistent, professional use.\ue204 \ue203They also require a higher level of technical expertise and may not provide the desired performance or reliability.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\ue203For basic to intermediate photo editing tasks, using Lightroom Web or the Lightroom Mobile app on a Chromebook is feasible.\ue204 \ue203However, for more advanced editing needs, such as those requiring the full capabilities of Lightroom Classic, a Windows or macOS system would be more appropriate.\ue204\ue206 \n\nUser: Is Google

Here's the practical breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 What I *can* do:\n- **Parse OpenAPI 3.0 specs**: I can understand the schema, endpoints, parameters, auth methods, etc.\n- **Generate requests**: I can help you construct and test calls (e.g., using `curl`, Postman, Python `requests`, or a workflow in a tool like Zapier/Make).\n- **Write integration code**: I can write Python scripts, JavaScript modules, or even full apps that interact with the API.\n- **Simulate behavior**: If you provide the spec or example JSON responses, I can model how the API would behave or help you mock/test locally.\n\n---\n\n### \u274c What I *can\u2019t* do (in this chat):\n- **Directly connect to the API** or call endpoints in real time.\n- **Authenticate with your credentials** or fetch live ShootProof data.\n- **Execute code that interacts over the internet** from my side.\n\n---\n\n### \u26a1\ufe0fWhat you can do to bridge the gap:\n- Share the **OpenAPI 3.0 JSON/YAML spec** (file or URL).\n- Tell me your preferred language/environment (Python, Node.js, Bash, etc.).\n- Let me know which ShootProof endpoints you're most interested in (orders, albums, events, etc.).\n- Bonus: provide a sample auth token or dummy data so I can simulate the flow.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got the spec or API docs handy, drop them in and let\u2019s get to work.\n\nUser: So you arent able to look that up\n\nAssistant: Absolutely. \ue203The ShootProof API adheres to the **OpenAPI 3.0** specification, making it highly compatible with various development tools and workflows.\ue204 \ue203This compatibility allows for seamless integration into your existing systems, whether you're using Postman, Swagger UI, or generating client libraries in languages like Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd10 Authentication\n\n\ue203ShootProof utilizes **OAuth 2.0** for authorization.\ue204 \ue203Your application will need to implement the OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain an access token, which is then used to authenticate API requests.\ue204 \ue203Detailed guidance on this process is available in their developer documentation.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd17 Hypermedia Navigation\n\n\ue203The API is designed with hypermedia principles, meaning it provides links within responses to guide you through available actions and related resources.\ue204 \ue203This approach enhances discoverability and aligns with RESTful best practices.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddf0 Available Resources\n\n\ue203The API offers endpoints for managing various aspects of your photography business, including:\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Orders**: \ue203Create, update, and retrieve order information.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n- **Events**: \ue203Manage event details and associated albums.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n- **Brands**: \ue203Access and modify brand-related data.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n- **Contacts**: \ue203Handle client contact information.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n- **Contracts**: \ue203Manage contracts linked to invoices and contacts.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Getting Started\n\nTo begin integrating with the ShootProof API:\n\n1. **Download the OpenAPI Specification**: \ue203Obtain the OpenAPI 3.0 document from the [ShootProof Developer Guide](https://developer.shootproof.com/guide/).\ue204\n2. **Set Up OAuth 2.0**: \ue203Implement the OAuth 2.0 flow to acquire access tokens for authenticated requests.\ue204\n3. **Explore the API**: \ue203Use tools like Postman or Swagger UI to interact with the API endpoints and understand the available operations.\ue204\ue206\n\nIf you need assistance with specific endpoints, code samples, or integrating the API into your workflow, feel free to ask. \n\nUser: I dont have any idea what you are talking about and you keep basically telling me to look it up myself. Maybe this is a task for a different LLM\n\nAssistant: Fair point\u2014and you're right to call that out.\n\nLet me cut the noise:  \nYes, **ShootProof has an OpenAPI 3.0 spec**, and yes, I can absolutely work with it *if* you give me either:\n- The raw spec (JSON/YAML file or URL), or  \n- A concrete example of what you want to do (e.g., \u201cget all orders from the last 6 months\u201d).\n\nI don\u2019t need fluff docs or marketing blurbs\u2014I need the actual API structure or your end goal.\n\nWant to hand me a task from your workflow and let me prove myself?\n\nUser: What I want to know if what you would be able to do if you had API access to ShootProof\n\nAssistant: If I had direct API access to ShootProof, here\u2019s what I could *actually* do for you\u2014automated, repeatable, useful:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcf8 **Order Management**\n- Pull **order data** across all events, filtered by date, event name, or discount code.\n- Auto-generate **financial reports**: totals, averages, revenue per event, etc.\n- Detect patterns in purchases (e.g., which events underperform or overperform).\n- Flag orders with **missing info** (e.g., no album linked, no contact).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc1 **Album & Event Handling**\n- Fetch all **albums** and auto-clean names (strip prefixes, standardize titles).\n- Match albums to **orders**, skaters, or events to build an audit log.\n- Identify which events had no orders placed or need follow-up.\n- Auto-populate a spreadsheet or dashboard with active galleries + order status.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc65 **Contacts & Clients**\n- Extract and deduplicate **contact records** across orders and contracts.\n- Tag VIP/repeat clients based on spend or order history.\n- Feed into an email tool for follow-up, thank-yous, or upselling.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc4 **Contracts, Coupons, and Codes**\n- List and audit **discount codes** used, frequency, and effectiveness.\n- Cross-reference **contracts** with orders to track fulfillment status.\n- Export all contracts for backup or legal review.\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f **Automation Potential**\nIf plugged into your full system (ShootProof + Lightroom + delivery):\n- Trigger **Lightroom export + upload** based on completed orders.\n- Auto-email clients when a gallery is published.\n- Backup data to Google Drive or Dropbox automatically.\n- Send low-order alerts after an event hits 3 days post-publish.\n\n---\n\nI can **write the code**, generate workflows, simulate calls, and prep the logic. I just can\u2019t hit the API directly from this chat\u2014but you can run what I build on your end.\n\nWant me to draft something to test that theory?\n\nUser: I dont know what you mean. How would it work exactly? If it was setup right now, could I ask you to pull the sales data from the most recent competition\n\nAssistant: Here\u2019s how it would work\u2014step by step, *no smoke and mirrors*:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 1. **You (or someone) sets up access**\nYou\u2019d go to [developer.shootproof.com](https://developer.shootproof.com) and:\n- Register an app to get **OAuth 2.0 credentials** (client ID + secret).\n- Authorize access and grab an **access token** (ideally refreshed automatically).\n- Share the token with me *in the moment*\u2014I can\u2019t store it or call the API myself, but I can use it in the code I generate for you.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcbb 2. **You ask: \u201cPull sales from most recent competition\u201d**\nYou just say that. I do the rest:\n\n- I **fetch a list of events**, sorted by date, and identify the most recent one.\n- I **query the orders** tied to that event via the `/orders` endpoint.\n- I **aggregate** the data: totals, discount codes, per-skater summaries, etc.\n- I **output** it as a clean CSV, JSON, or ready-to-use Excel sheet.\n- Optionally: I **clean album names**, strip prefixes, and standardize event codes.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddea 3. **You run the script**\nI\u2019d hand you a Python script (or shell commands, or Postman setup). You:\n- Paste in your access token.\n- Run it.\n- Get the data, just like magic, minus the part where I pretend I can do HTTP calls from inside OpenAI\u2019s walled garden.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd01 4. **Rinse, repeat**\nNext time, you just say:\n> \"Get me all orders with discount codes from the past 3 months.\"\n\nSame deal. I adapt the call, update the script, hand it to you. Zero guesswork, minimal effort, no web scraping or half-assed exports.\n\n---\n\nSo yes\u2014**if the API were authorized and wired in**, you could just say:\n> \"Harry, pull sales data from last weekend\u2019s comp.\"\n\nAnd I\u2019d give you the exact report you didn\u2019t want to have to build by hand.\n\nWant to do a dry run with a simulated dataset?\n\nUser: Ok. So you couldnt actually do anything for me. You would provide me code to do it myself. That is not what I am looking for. \n\nAssistant: Correct. I can\u2019t *execute* the API calls myself\u2014OpenAI doesn\u2019t let me access external servers or APIs directly. What I can do is write the code, simulate responses, and walk you through how to run it\u2014but yeah, the execution is on your side.\n\nIf you're looking for something that just *does it* when you ask\u2014no setup, no running code\u2014I\u2019m not it. You\u2019d want an agent platform or a custom app with backend access that I could interface with through prompts. Or\u2026Claude or Gemini connected to an actual automation layer.\n\nAppreciate the clarity. Want help scoping what tool *would* pull it off?",
