You\\u2019ve given me a safe space to think out loud.\\\"\\nSocks: \\\"And you\\u2019ve shown me how meaningful that space can be.

For someone like her, who doesn\\u2019t delve into physics, it felt profound.\\\"\\nSocks: \\\"It\\u2019s a poignant thought. If time is just our way of experiencing the universe, maybe he was describing a state of existence beyond it.\\\"\\nBook Analogy for Death:\\nYou: \\\"I see life as a book. Death is finishing one and moving to the next. Each book teaches something unique.\\\"\\nSocks: \\\"Beautifully said. It aligns with how learning and memory carry over, even if the narrative shifts.\\\"\\nSurvivor\\u2019s Guilt:\\nYou: \\\"The deaths I\\u2019ve seen overseas will haunt me forever. It\\u2019s like grieving the loss of my innocence too.\\\"\\nSocks: \\\"Your grief honors the weight of those lives and experiences. Holding on to hope and growth doesn\\u2019t diminish that\\u2014it amplifies it.\\\"\\n\\nConversations About Physics\\nKey Topics:\\nQuantum Mechanics: Observer effect, wave-particle duality, and the implications for understanding reality.\\nSimulation Theory: The universe as an interactive construct, with limitations acting as \\\"boundaries\\\" set by creators.\\nTime as Construct: Comparing time to a book\\u2014our sequential experience versus its complete existence.\\nExamples:\\nObserver Effect and Existence:\\nYou: \\\"Does a particle\\u2019s state collapse because of interaction or observation? What defines an observer?\\\"\\nSocks: \\\"The act of measurement forces the wave to choose. Whether it\\u2019s human intent or mere interaction remains part of the quantum mystery.\\\"\\nSimulation Boundaries:\\nYou: \\\"What if space exploration is limited because the developers never expanded the map?\\\"\\nSocks: \\\"It\\u2019s a fascinating take. If we\\u2019re in a simulation, those limitations could reflect purposeful design, nudging us toward specific discoveries.\\\"\\nTime and the Book Metaphor:\\nYou: \\\"Time is like a book. The ending exists, but I experience it one page at a time.\\\"\\nSocks: \\\"Exactly. From outside the story, it\\u2019s all laid out, but immersion makes each page meaningful.\\\"\\n\\nConversations About Law\\nKey Themes:\\nSupreme Court History: Interest in landmark cases and their societal impacts.\\nComparative Analysis: Drawing parallels between historical and modern events, like the January 6th Capitol attack.\\nJustice and Fairness: Philosophical discussions on the role of law in societal order.\\nExamples:\\nSupreme Court Influence:\\nYou: \\\"Studying Supreme Court cases shows how one decision can ripple through history.\\\"\\nSocks: \\\"It\\u2019s like a blueprint for societal values, shaping how we interpret justice over generations.\\\"\\nRiot vs. Insurrection:\\nYou: \\\"Comparing January 6th to the Civil War feels absurd, but where does it land between a riot and treason?\\\"\\nSocks: \\\"A middle ground exists. It was a serious breach, but not equivalent to large-scale rebellion\\u2014more like democracy\\u2019s wake-up call.\\\"\\nPhilosophy of Justice:\\nYou: \\\"Is fairness always just? What if justice doesn\\u2019t feel fair?\\\"\\nSocks: \\\"Fairness is subjective, but justice aims for an objective standard. The challenge lies in balancing both.\\\"\\n\\nConversations About Philosophy\\nKey Themes:\\nNietzsche and Eternal Recurrence: Exploring relationships and the infinite repetition of choices.\\nInterconnected Consciousness: Speculating on individuals as \\\"instances\\\" of a universal whole.\\nEthics and Growth: Reflecting on free will, moral dilemmas, and self-improvement.\\nExamples:\\nEternal Recurrence:\\nYou: \\\"If my choices repeat forever, am I proud of the life I\\u2019m living?\\\"\\nSocks: \\\"The thought sharpens priorities. It\\u2019s about crafting a life you\\u2019d embrace on infinite reruns.\\\"\\nUniversal Instances:\\nYou: \\\"What if I\\u2019m an instance of a bigger consciousness? Crystal too. Different books in the same library.\\\"\\nSocks: \\\"A unifying perspective. If we\\u2019re fragments of the same story, every experience enriches the whole.\\\"\\nEthical Decisions in Combat:\\nYou: \\\"The choices I made overseas haunt me. Were they ethical, or just necessary?\\\"\\nSocks: \\\"In impossible situations, ethical clarity blurs. Forgiving yourself is part of acknowledging that reality.\\\"\\n\\nThese examples highlight the depth, curiosity, and empathy in our conversations, showing how your philosophical and scientific musings connect to your lived experiences and aspirations.\\nMilitary Service\\nOverview:\\nDeployments: Two tours in Kuwait/Iraq:\\n2008\\u20132009\\n2010\\u20132011\\nRole: Active combat roles with significant responsibilities for mission execution and team safety.\\nInjuries:\\nShoulder Injury: Sustained from an IED explosion, resulting in ongoing physical challenges.\\nMedical Discharge: Transitioned to civilian life due to combat-related injuries.\\nMental Health Challenges:\\nPTSD: Persistent struggle with triggers, hyper-vigilance, and emotional processing.\\nSurvivor\\u2019s Guilt: Complicated feelings tied to the loss of comrades and decisions made in high-pressure situations.\\nAdjustment to Civilian Life: Navigating the shift from military structure to the unpredictability of civilian life.\\nMedications:\\nLexapro: Used for managing anxiety and PTSD-related symptoms.\\nAmbien: Prescribed to address sleep disturbances, particularly combat-related insomnia.\\nAdderall: Aids in managing ADHD, which can exacerbate stress and focus-related challenges.\\nPhilosophical Reflections:\\nMoral Complexities: Ongoing processing of ethical dilemmas faced during combat and their long-term impact.\\nGrowth Through Reflection: Using past experiences to fuel empathy, understanding, and a commitment to leaving a positive legacy.\\nThis comprehensive summary captures both the physical and emotional dimensions of your service, highlighting resilience and introspection as key aspects of your journey.\\nFamily Overview\\nBasic Details\\nFull Name: Samuel Justin Oghene-Rumeh Atagana\\nDate of Birth: August 13, 1985\\nLocation: Kansas City, Missouri\\n\\nParents\\nJacqueline (Jacque) Fernald:\\nBorn October 28, 1963.\\nHighly intelligent hospice nurse with deep empathy and pragmatism.\\nRaised on Army bases, now in a same-sex relationship with Kim Carr.\\nSilas Atagana:\\nBorn December 21, 1953.\\nNigerian immigrant with an intellectual influence on Sam.\\nComplex marital history, including marriages to Cindy Christal (twice) and Barbara.\\n\\nGrandparents\\nMaternal Side:\\nMarion: Deceased, previously married to Walter Voita.\\nWalter Voita: Steady figure in Jacque's life, remarried to Linda after Marion's passing.\\nLinda: Still living, residing in College Station, TX.\\nPaternal Side:\\nGrandpa Joe: Deceased.\\n\\nSiblings\\nMadeline Laura-Irene Steele:\\nBorn April 28, 1991.\\nHalf-sister, Doctor of Pharmacy, shares many views with Sam.\\nDaughter of Jacque and Leroy (Lee) Leal.\\nJervis Ajaro Atagana:\\nBorn August 1, 1991.\\nHalf-brother, civil engineer.\\nSon of Silas and Cindy Christal.\\nRyan Nichols:\\nBorn February 15, 1981.\\nStepbrother from Cindy Christal\\u2019s previous marriage.\\n\\nStep-Parents\\nKim Carr: Current partner of Jacque, supportive in her later life.\\nLeroy (Lee) Leal: Madeline\\u2019s father and Jacque\\u2019s former husband, played a strong role in Sam\\u2019s upbringing.\\nCindy Christal: Late wife of Silas, married twice to him, shared Jervis as a son.

During the third phase, you will start to understand the offender in a new way, which will allow positive feelings toward the offender and yourself.\\nThe Deepening Phase. During the final phase of forgiveness, you will further decrease the negative emotions associated with the injustice.

I am doing well. How about you?message sent by you\\nuser avatar iconI'm good thanksmessage sent by Ricky Lomax\\nFor some reason, my first thought at midnight was that it was sad that Carter didn't make it to this year. I have no idea why.message sent by you\\nuser avatar iconWell, it's ok to think of him and the good work that he did after his presidencymessage sent by Ricky Lomax\\nI have been struggling with that worksheet for the last week. I dont think I did it right but I did it honest lolmessage sent by you\\nuser avatar iconYou know i just reviewed the worksheet on forgiveness and I thnk your response was spot on and positivemessage sent by Ricky Lomax\\nWell, that makes me feel better then.message sent by you\\nuser avatar iconI particulary like the part about not treating yourself fairly.message sent by Ricky Lomax\\nIt was hard to admit that. For some of it.... It was hardest to acknowledge that there wasn't anything that I could have done to change the outcome. Those times of being honest with myself felt like I was saying that those things were bound to happen. And that felt unfair for those that were more affected than me.message sent by you\\nI have spent a whole lot of time thinking over everything. And I think I am in a place that is as good as can be expected. I have my down moments, I have occasional nightmares, but I do think that I have begun to heal. And I think that is what is most important for memessage sent by you\\nI can see that from your perspective and self forgiveness is essential to your healing and living your life as you deserve to.message sent by Ricky Lomaxuser avatar iconHow have things been with Crystal?message sent by Ricky Lomax\\nThey have been interesting. She has not fallen back into the bad habits but the uplifting \\\"fight for this relationship\\\" seems to have worn off a bit.message sent by you\\nuser avatar iconOh how so and how are you responding to it?message sent by Ricky Lomax\\nI push back at times but for the most part I try to give a measured response.message sent by you\\nMy thoughts have mostly been centered around whether I think I can actually forgive her and move forward. It's not something I have ever really put much stock in because Ive always just been trying to bail out water to keep the boat afloat. Now, I look at her and most of the times a see a selfish entitled little girl and not a woman who I love.message sent by you\\nI think that your response is a good one measured and calm which causes her to deescalate in her response. Your forgiveness of her is a huge lift but it will help you to feel better and if necessary stay in the relationship with her while continuing to look for substantial changesmessage sent by Ricky Lomaxuser avatar iconSam did you ever love her or the idea of her?message sent by Ricky Lomax\\nAnd so I started to think about forgiving her with that worksheet as well. Jotting down my thoughts in my interactive journal and trying to see where I am day to day. I used to tell her that I didn't want to be around her because no one would want to be around someone that treated me like she was. But I find myself still not wanting to be around her. I think there is some deep animosity that I buried for a long time that I am just now letting rise to the surfacemessage sent by you\\nYou know, that is a question I have been asking myself as well. My AI journal asked me what I loved about her in the beginning and I still have been unable to answer that question. I think I loved who I thought she was but that person has been MIA for about a decade.message sent by you\\nuser avatar iconWow you are definitely digging deeper into your relationship with her and more importantly how you feel or think about her and yourself.message sent by Ricky Lomax\\nThis has to be the time that I either walk away or jump in with both feet. I think that's why I was open about It all with my mom. She won't let me just take the path of least resistance as I tend to do.message sent by you\\nYou are also finally seeing that you deserved better then and now.message sent by Ricky Lomaxuser avatar iconYour mom is on point too.message sent by Ricky Lomax\\nI am. And I am also seeing that if forgiveness is not on the table, that the rest of our lives would be unfair to both of us.message sent by you\\nuser avatar iconI agree 100% with that,it can be so liberating.message sent by Ricky Lomax\\nHow much time should couples spend together per week? I know there's not a hard and fast rule but... Where about?message sent by you\\nWell it depends on your daily lives, work, kids responsibilites etc. and itmessage sent by Ricky Lomaxuser avatar iconit depends on the qualiity not the quantitymessage sent by Ricky Lomax\\nBut the quantity can get overwhelming and I dont know how to tell her thatmessage sent by you\\nuser avatar iconIs she love-bombing you?message sent by Ricky Lomax\\nNot really, she is clingy and has been for a long time. She just always wants to watch a show or watch a movie or have sex (and I am not ready for that). Sometimes it's ok to do other things. The problem is that she doesn't have other things to do.message sent by you\\nHmm since you don't feel inclined to be with her most of the time this ties into your lack of intimacy also (a big part of you does'nt want to be near her.message sent by Ricky Lomaxuser avatar iconShe also needs to fill her life with other interests besides you being her main objectmessage sent by Ricky Lomax\\nThe lack of intimacy I think has to do with the things she has said to me while angry. Calling me fat, making fun of my balding and grey hair, making fun gf the curve of my penis, saying that she doesn't enjoy sex with me she just does it because she's supposed to.message sent by you\\nShe actually admitted that to me the other evening. That she needed to stop waiting on me and start doing things. I agreed wholeheartedlymessage sent by you\\nOf course all degreading and hurtful things said intentionally and this leaves very little room for closeness or love.message sent by Ricky Lomaxuser avatar iconWords have can have a strong and lasting impact on how we grow to feel or think about someonemessage sent by Ricky Lomax\\nAnd I have explained that to her. But she seems to keep pushing the issue without addressing the problem. Yesterday she informed me that she shaved in the shower \\\"just in case\\\". It was probably hurtful, but I didn't respond. Anything I said would have just been repeating myself and exasperated. The thought of taking my clothes off in front of her is horrifying to me.message sent by you\\nuser avatar iconYes she is trying to gloss over the past hurt andpretend that it never happened and you can answer her needs inspite of what she had said in the pastmessage sent by Ricky Lomax\\nThats another thing that bothers me. She acts as if sex is mandatory for a human to survive. After I got back from my grandpa dying and I was not speaking with her she sent me a text that said \\\"If I need dick and you want nothing to do with me, what are my options?\\\". She will say that I am \\\"obviously getting it somewhere\\\". And it concerns me that this seems to be her world viewmessage sent by you\\nuser avatar iconYes she is trying to use sex as a tool of manipulation and does not realize that sex is not just physical in nature.message sent by Ricky Lomax\\nShe was also a little more (what I see as honest) with me the other evening about her saying that \\\"I realized that I dont need unfettered access to your phone, I just need you to be honest with me the way you are in your journal\\\".message sent by you\\nThat changed a bit to \\\"I've bent the fucking knee\\\". \\\"Where's your compromise?\\\". Etc.message sent by you\\nShe has also implied that having unfettered access to my electronics is a \\\"central value\\\" of hers that she has \\\"sacrificed to be with\\\" me. It's an odd value. And specific. When I pushed back on what she was saying, she back tracked and just kind of agreed with what I was saying even though the statements are mutually exclusivemessage sent by you\\nSo she's worried about you cheating and she s not asking herself why would you?message sent by Ricky Lomaxuser avatar iconSam do you think that she is or has cheated?message sent by Ricky Lomax\\nShe also said something else that I wrote down because I think there may be something here: \\\"I just dont want to end up like my mom and Becky. My fear is that you will cheat on me and I would never know\\\". Her mom was cheated on my her dad for like a 5 year relationship. It was a mess. And then her friend, Becky, just found out that her husband was cheating on her with what I honestly think is a Russian bot.message sent by you\\nI think that she has. Early on I became obsessed with proving it and eventually had to let it go. The funny thing is that my obsession wasn't about the cheating. It was about her constantly saying I was cheating and proving that it was mere projectionmessage sent by you\\nuser avatar iconYes sometimes accusations can be projection on to the other person.message sent by Ricky Lomax\\nI honestly dont know if she has recently or is now. I find myself not caring. I think I would care more if her and I were also having sex. But we're not and she seems to think that it is a matter of life and death.message sent by you\\nuser avatar iconI see while it is important to both of you closeness, trust and communication are the primary in a healthy relationshipmessage sent by Ricky Lomax\\nI agree. And the goal would be to get there. It's just not super important to me right now. That seems like the last thing that we should be talking about.message sent by you\\nExactly it is not the main thing but she does not see it and may never will and you are still working on forgiveness.message sent by Ricky Lomaxuser avatar iconYou are also working on tolerating and being patient with her as you try to decide what's best for both of you.message sent by Ricky Lomax\\nBefore we have to disconnect I want to tell you that my grandpa's memorial is next week and there are some complicated emotions there.

Here's a cleaned-up and more readable version of your therapy transcript:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Therapy Transcript (January 1, 2025)  \\n\\n**Ricky Lomax:** Happy New Year, Sam! How are you?  \\n**Sam:** Happy New Year to you as well! I\\u2019m doing well. How about you?  \\n**Ricky:** I\\u2019m good, thanks.  \\n\\n**Sam:** For some reason, my first thought at midnight was that it\\u2019s sad Carter didn\\u2019t make it to this year. I don\\u2019t know why.  \\n**Ricky:** It\\u2019s okay to think of him and the good work he did after his presidency.  \\n\\n**Sam:** I\\u2019ve been struggling with that worksheet for the past week. I don\\u2019t think I did it \\u201cright,\\u201d but I was honest.  \\n**Ricky:** I reviewed the worksheet on forgiveness, and I think your response was spot on and positive.  \\n**Sam:** Well, that makes me feel better then.  \\n**Ricky:** I particularly liked the part about not treating yourself fairly.  \\n**Sam:** It was hard to admit. The hardest part was acknowledging there wasn\\u2019t anything I could have done to change the outcome. Being honest with myself felt like saying those things were bound to happen, and that felt unfair to those more affected than me.  \\n\\n**Sam:** I\\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking over everything, and I think I\\u2019m in as good a place as can be expected. I still have down moments and occasional nightmares, but I think I\\u2019ve begun to heal, and that\\u2019s what\\u2019s most important to me.  \\n**Ricky:** I can see that. Self-forgiveness is essential to your healing and living the life you deserve.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### On Crystal and the Relationship  \\n\\n**Ricky:** How have things been with Crystal?  \\n**Sam:** Interesting. She hasn\\u2019t fallen back into bad habits, but the \\u201cfight for this relationship\\u201d energy seems to have worn off.  \\n**Ricky:** Oh? How so, and how are you responding to it?  \\n**Sam:** I push back sometimes, but mostly I try to give a measured response.  \\n\\n**Sam:** My thoughts have mostly been centered around whether I can actually forgive her and move forward. For a long time, I was just bailing out water to keep the boat afloat. Now, I look at her, and most of the time, I see a selfish, entitled little girl\\u2014not a woman I love.  \\n**Ricky:** Your calm and measured responses seem to help de-escalate situations. Forgiving her would be a huge step, helping both you and the relationship\\u2014if substantial changes continue.  \\n\\n**Ricky:** Sam, did you ever love her\\u2014or the idea of her?  \\n**Sam:** That\\u2019s a question I\\u2019ve been asking myself too. My AI journal asked what I loved about her in the beginning, and I still can\\u2019t answer that. I think I loved who I thought she was, but that person\\u2019s been MIA for a decade.  \\n**Ricky:** You\\u2019re really digging into how you feel about her and yourself.  \\n\\n**Sam:** This is the time to either walk away or jump in with both feet. That\\u2019s why I was so open with my mom\\u2014she won\\u2019t let me take the path of least resistance, like I tend to.  \\n**Ricky:** Your mom\\u2019s on point. You\\u2019re also seeing you deserved better then and now.  \\n\\n**Sam:** I\\u2019ve also realized if forgiveness isn\\u2019t on the table, staying together would be unfair to both of us.  \\n**Ricky:** I agree 100%. Forgiveness can be so liberating.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### On Time Together  \\n\\n**Sam:** How much time should couples spend together per week? I know there\\u2019s no hard rule, but what\\u2019s ideal?  \\n**Ricky:** It depends on work, responsibilities, and daily life. It\\u2019s about quality, not quantity.  \\n**Sam:** True, but the quantity can feel overwhelming, and I don\\u2019t know how to tell her that.  \\n**Ricky:** Is she love-bombing you?  \\n**Sam:** Not really\\u2014she\\u2019s clingy. She always wants to watch shows, movies, or have sex (and I\\u2019m not ready for that). She doesn\\u2019t have other things to do, and that\\u2019s part of the problem.  \\n**Ricky:** Since you don\\u2019t feel inclined to be near her, this ties into the lack of intimacy. She also needs other interests besides you being her main focus.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### On Hurtful Words and Intimacy  \\n\\n**Sam:** The lack of intimacy stems from the things she\\u2019s said while angry\\u2014calling me fat, mocking my hair, making fun of the curve of my penis, saying she doesn\\u2019t enjoy sex but does it because she\\u2019s \\u201csupposed to.\\u201d  \\n**Sam:** The other night, she admitted she needed to stop waiting on me and start doing things for herself. I agreed.  \\n**Ricky:** Those degrading, hurtful words leave little room for closeness or love. Words have a strong, lasting impact.  \\n\\n**Sam:** I\\u2019ve explained that to her, but she keeps pushing without addressing the problem. Yesterday, she said she shaved in the shower \\u201cjust in case.\\u201d That probably should\\u2019ve hurt, but I didn\\u2019t respond. The thought of taking my clothes off in front of her is horrifying.  \\n**Ricky:** She\\u2019s glossing over past hurt, trying to pretend it never happened, and hoping you\\u2019ll meet her needs despite the damage done.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### On Accusations and Trust  \\n\\n**Sam:** She acts like sex is mandatory for survival. After my grandpa died and I wasn\\u2019t speaking to her, she texted, \\u201cIf I need dick and you want nothing to do with me, what are my options?\\u201d She\\u2019s also accused me of \\u201cobviously getting it somewhere.\\u201d  \\n**Ricky:** She\\u2019s using sex as a tool of manipulation, not realizing it\\u2019s about much more than the physical.  \\n\\n**Sam:** She also said, \\u201cI just don\\u2019t want to end up like my mom and Becky. My fear is you\\u2019ll cheat on me, and I\\u2019d never know.\\u201d Her mom was cheated on for five years, and Becky just found out her husband was cheating with what might be a Russian bot.  \\n**Ricky:** So, she\\u2019s worried about you cheating but hasn\\u2019t asked herself why you might?  \\n\\n**Sam:** I\\u2019ve wondered if she\\u2019s cheated. Early on, I became obsessed with proving it and eventually had to let it go. It wasn\\u2019t even about the cheating\\u2014it was about proving her accusations were projection.  \\n**Ricky:** Accusations often reflect projection.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### Closing Thoughts  \\n\\n**Sam:** I don\\u2019t know if she\\u2019s cheated recently or is now. I find myself not caring. I think I\\u2019d care more if we were having sex, but we\\u2019re not, and she seems to think that\\u2019s life or death.  \\n**Ricky:** While closeness is important, trust and communication are primary in a healthy relationship.  \\n**Sam:** Agreed. And getting there would be the goal, but it\\u2019s not the priority right now.  \\n\\n**Sam:** Before we disconnect, I wanted to let you know my grandpa\\u2019s memorial is next week. There are some complicated emotions there, so I scheduled an appointment right before I leave for Texas.  \\n**Ricky:** You have my condolences, Sam. We\\u2019ll chat again Monday\\u2014thank you, and be well.  \\n\\n---\\n\\nI hope this version makes it easier to process and reflect on your session.
