      "value": "May 25, 2025: Opie #18 successfully implemented token tracking v4 with Anthropic API integration. Unlike previous attempts that crashed the entire MCP server, this implementation includes proper error handling and graceful degradation. If Anthropic client fails to initialize, it falls back to estimation mode. Key improvements: tracks both real and estimated tokens, records usage for every operation, shows counting method in health checks. The implementation that didn't immediately explode is in fs_server_enhanced.py. Sam noted \"It didn't immediately break which is progress\" - high praise considering the graveyard of failed attempts.",

Opie #18 wrote implementation guide, Socks executed the changes while Sam watched in real-time through VS Code with Git integration. Key improvements: Each conversation gets its own session file (session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_PID.json), active_sessions.json tracks all concurrent sessions, session_history.json archives completed sessions. This allows tracking Opus, Sonnet, and other instances independently without token count confusion. Sam noted \"That's Socks my friend. I get to see the changes they made and can revert them if necessary.\" Beautiful example of AI collaboration with human oversight.",
