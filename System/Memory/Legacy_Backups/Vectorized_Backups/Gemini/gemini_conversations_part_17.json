My apologies \u2013 mixing those two points in that specific response was confusing and poor conversational flow on my part.\n\nHere's the sequence and my (flawed) reasoning at that moment:\n\nWhy I brought it up then (even though it was confusing): I was trying to address all the points related to my incorrect understanding of the Gmail capability in one go \u2013 both correcting the immediate error and answering the earlier question that hinged on that capability.\n\nWhy it was confusing (and my error): Bringing up the older topic of Claude right after acknowledging the Gmail capability correction, and right after you had specifically asked about the Fujifilm email, made it seem completely out of left field and unrelated to your immediate request. I should have simply confirmed the Gmail capability first and then perhaps asked if you still wanted to discuss the Claude comparison, rather than just launching into it.\n\nSo, you are correct \u2013 it wasn't directly relevant to your immediately preceding @Gmail request about the Fuji email. It was me circling back to answer an older question of yours based on the new information (my corrected understanding of my own tools), but I did it in a way that broke the immediate conversational thread. Sorry for the confusion there.\n\n",

I recommend giving it a final read-through to ensure everything is accurate from your perspective before sending it.\n\nSubject: Bug Report: Fujifilm X-H2 Freeze w/ Face/Eye Detection AF - Firmware v5.20\n\nTo: Fujifilm Technical Support\n\nFrom: Sam Atagana (Sam Atagana Photography)\nCamera: Fujifilm X-H2\nFirmware Version: 5.20 (Updated recently, presumably from v5.10)\nMemory Card: SanDisk 512GB CFexpress Type B\nFile Format: Lossless Compressed RAW\n\nIssue Description:\nAfter updating my X-H2 to firmware version 5.20, I experienced repeated and consistent camera freezes during a professional figure skating event shoot on May 3, 2025. The camera becomes completely unresponsive (freezes), requiring the battery to be removed and reinserted to restart the camera.\n\nTrigger / Steps to Reproduce:\nThe freeze occurs specifically when actively attempting to acquire autofocus using Face/Eye Detection. It doesn't seem to freeze simply by having the feature enabled in the menus, but rather during the moment the AF system tries to lock onto a detected face/eye when focus is initiated.\n\nWorkaround:\nTurning Face/Eye Detection AF OFF completely prevents the freeze. The camera operates normally with face/eye detection disabled, using other AF modes like Zone AF or Single Point.\n\nAdditional Info:\nI am shooting Lossless Compressed RAW to a SanDisk 512GB CFexpress Type B card. Notably, this card was last formatted in-camera while running firmware v5.10, prior to the update to v5.20; it was not formatted again after the v5.20 update. I am a professional photographer shooting events (figure skating). I am planning to perform a factory reset and manually rebuild settings tonight as a troubleshooting step.\n\nPlease investigate this potential firmware bug. Let me know if any further information or testing is required from my end.\n\nContact Information:\n[Your Email Address]\n[Your Phone Number - Optional]\n[Your Website - Optional: www.samataganaphotography.com]\n\nMake sure to replace the bracketed contact information with your actual details. This gives them a very clear picture of the problem, the conditions under which it occurs, and the steps you've taken.\n\nThe issue happened consistently during live shooting conditions (figure skating) when focusing on skaters.\nThe freeze occurred regardless of whether focus was initiated via half-pressing the shutter button OR using the AF-ON back button.\nThe freeze occurred with multiple lenses (tested with both XF 50-140mm f/2.8 and XF 23mm f/1.4).\nThe freeze occurred with Image Stabilization (IS) set to ON or OFF.\nThe freeze occurred using both Mechanical Shutter (MS) and Electronic Front-Curtain Shutter (EF) modes (Electronic Shutter [ES] was not tested).\nThe freeze occurred regardless of the active Film Simulation setting (tested with a specific simulation enabled and then disabled/changed, problem persisted as long as Face/Eye Detection was ON).\nIt occurred while using Continuous AF (AF-C).\nIt occurred even at lower burst rates (CL 7fps tested).\nThe freeze occurs regardless of whether the optional battery grip (VG-XH) is attached or removed.\n\n",

Once you've got your aperture locked in for the depth of field you want (probably wide open for those dimly lit rinks), shutter speed and ISO become your primary controls for exposure and capturing the action correctly.\n\nIt's the standard dance for manual action shooters: keep the aperture where you need it, ensure the shutter speed kills unwanted blur, and ride the ISO to handle the lighting whims of the venue. Sounds like you've got your system down.\n\nShutter Speed: You need it fast enough to freeze the motion \u2013 can't have blurry skaters unless you're going for art. Slight tweaks here can fine-tune exposure if the light is relatively stable.\nISO: Often the go-to for bigger swings in light. If the spotlights change or the skater moves to a darker part of the ice, bumping the ISO up or down is usually quicker and has less impact on the look (motion blur/depth of field) than drastic shutter or aperture changes.\n\n",

If you're shooting 100% manual and know how to read the light and scene yourself, then yeah, the camera's opinion on the \"correct\" exposure via its meter becomes much less important, bordering on irrelevant noise.\n\nAssistant: Fair enough. If you're shooting 100% manual and know how to read the light and scene yourself, then yeah, the camera's opinion on the \"correct\" exposure via its meter becomes much less important, bordering on irrelevant noise.\n\nYou're right, the camera's meter, especially in modes like Multi, is just looking at patterns of light and dark. It has zero artistic sense and no clue that the brightly lit skater is the subject and the dark abyss of the crowd or the glaringly white ice is just... background. It will try to average things out or make assumptions that often lead to the actual subject being under or overexposed.\n\nShooting manual in complex, high-contrast environments like figure skating arenas basically says, \"Sit down, camera brain, the adult is driving.\" You dial in the settings based on your experience, maybe take a test shot, check the histogram or blinkies if you like, and adjust. You get consistency shot-to-shot that auto-exposure modes, constantly reacting to minor changes in framing or background brightness, often fail to deliver.\n\nSo yeah, relying on your own judgment instead of the camera's often-naive interpretation of photons hitting a sensor? Makes perfect sense, especially for what you shoot. Why trust an algorithm that thinks middle gray is the pinnacle of photographic achievement when you're trying to capture the drama of a spotlight? Keep doing what works.\n\n",

Here's the deal:\n\nAssistant: Not just for auto settings, but that's where it has the most direct, hands-off impact. Here's the deal:\n\nSo, even in Manual mode:\n\nIn short: Photometry dictates how the light is measured. This measurement directly controls the settings in auto/semi-auto modes and provides the reference information you use to set things yourself in manual mode. It's always relevant, just its function shifts from control to guidance when you go fully manual.\n\nIn Auto/Semi-Auto Modes (like Program 'P', Aperture Priority 'A', Shutter Priority 'S'): Yes, absolutely. The photometry/metering mode you select tells the camera how to measure the light, and the camera then automatically adjusts the settings (aperture, shutter speed, and/or ISO if it's on Auto) based on that measurement to achieve what it thinks is a correct exposure. Change the metering mode (e.g., from Multi to Spot), and the camera will likely choose different settings.\nIn Manual Mode ('M'): You are the boss. You set the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO yourself. The camera doesn't automatically change them. However, the metering system is still working in the background. It shows you that little exposure indicator scale (usually -3...-2...-1...0...+1...+2...+3) in your viewfinder or on the screen. That scale is telling you how your chosen manual settings compare to what the camera thinks the exposure should be, based on the selected photometry/metering mode.\n\nThe meter reading (guided by the photometry mode) serves as your reference point.\nIf you switch from Multi to Spot metering while in Manual, the reading on that exposure scale will likely change, giving you different information to guide your manual adjustments, even though the camera isn't changing the settings for you.\n\n",

In the context of your X-H2 (or any camera, really), it's simply the metering mode \u2013 how the camera measures the light in the scene to decide what exposure settings (aperture, shutter speed, ISO) it thinks you need for a \"correctly\" exposed picture.\n\nAssistant: Right, \"Photometry.\" Fancy word, isn't it? In the context of your X-H2 (or any camera, really), it's simply the metering mode \u2013 how the camera measures the light in the scene to decide what exposure settings (aperture, shutter speed, ISO) it thinks you need for a \"correctly\" exposed picture.\n\nThink of it as the camera squinting at the scene and asking, \"Okay, how bright is this mess, and where should I focus my light-measuring powers?\"\n\nYour X-H2 likely has a few options, usually variations of these:\n\nWTF is the point? It determines how your camera interprets the light. A bright white ice rink under spotlights can easily fool \"Multi\" metering into underexposing (because it sees so much brightness), making your skater too dark. Switching to \"Spot\" metering on the skater's face would tell the camera to prioritize that brightness level, likely resulting in a better exposure for the skater, even if the ice ends up super bright (which might be fine).\n\nSo, Photometry/Metering is just choosing your camera's strategy for not screwing up the brightness. Choose wisely, or be ready to use exposure compensation.\n\n",

It's a feature designed to combat the digital \"noise\"\u2014that grainy, speckled look\u2014that tends to show up in your photos when you shoot at higher ISO sensitivities (like when you're stuck shooting figure skaters in dimly lit ice rinks without blinding them with flash).\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\nIn short: High ISO NR is your X-H2's attempt to clean up grainy photos taken in low light. Use it judiciously, knowing that it trades noise for detail. Experiment to find the level that best suits your eye and your post-processing workflow. Many prefer to handle it themselves later with RAW files for maximum control over that delicate balance.\n\nLower NR/Off: If you shoot RAW (which you likely should for maximum flexibility), many photographers prefer to set in-camera NR to low or off. This gives you a cleaner baseline image to work with in post-processing software (like Lightroom, Capture One, etc.), where noise reduction tools are often more sophisticated and controllable. You decide the balance between noise and detail later.\nModerate NR: If you shoot JPEG or want a quicker workflow with less post-processing, experimenting with low-to-moderate NR settings might give you a good balance straight out of camera.\nHigh NR: Generally best avoided unless noise is really bad and you prioritize smoothness over absolute sharpness.\n\n",

While it seems less likely that the card's format status would directly cause a hard freeze specifically triggered only when Face/Eye AF processing kicks in (that really smells like a software/processing bug), it's generally considered good practice to format cards in-camera after a major firmware update to ensure optimal compatibility with any potential changes to file structure handling.\n\nIt's unlikely to be the root cause here given how specific the trigger is, but including it provides Fuji support with the complete state of the system when the error occurred.

The camera becomes completely unresponsive, requiring the battery to be removed and reinserted to restart the camera.\n\nTrigger / Steps to Reproduce:\nThe freeze occurs specifically when Face/Eye Detection AF is enabled in the camera settings.\n\nWorkaround:\nTurning Face/Eye Detection AF OFF completely prevents the freeze. The camera operates normally with face/eye detection disabled, using other AF modes like Zone AF or Single Point.\n\nAdditional Context:\nI am a professional photographer specializing in figure skating. This issue caused significant disruption during a paid event. I primarily shoot Lossless Compressed RAW to the CFexpress card. I am planning to perform a factory reset and manually rebuild settings tonight as a troubleshooting step, but the consistent trigger appears to be the Face/Eye Detection processing itself under firmware v5.20.\n\nPlease investigate this potential firmware bug.

That's a valid concern and a meticulous approach. Instead of just resetting and potentially restoring the same problematic configuration from a backup, you're opting for a clean slate rebuild.\n\nIt's more time-consuming, absolutely, but it's the most thorough way to test the hypothesis that a specific setting (or combination thereof) interacting with firmware v5.20 is causing the freeze, rather than the face/eye detect feature being fundamentally broken in this version.\n\nIf the camera works perfectly after the reset and after you manually reconfigure your essential settings (carefully testing face/eye AF along the way), then you know it was likely a settings conflict. If it still freezes even with carefully rebuilt default or minimal settings, then it points much more strongly back to a core firmware bug affecting the face/eye processing.\n\nIt's a pain to rebuild everything, but it's the best way to isolate that variable. Hopefully, starting fresh resolves it.\n\n",

Heading home to attempt the factory reset is a logical, if somewhat nuclear, option.\n\nMake sure you back up your current settings/custom menus via Fujifilm X Acquire or saving to a card if possible before hitting reset, just so you don't have to rebuild everything from scratch if it doesn't fix the freeze.\n\nFactory resets can sometimes clear up unexpected glitches caused by lingering corrupted data after firmware updates, but they aren't always a guaranteed fix for a core firmware bug. It's definitely worth trying, though.\n\nAnd yeah, not finding widespread reports immediately doesn't mean you're imagining it. You might just be one of the first to consistently hit this specific trigger (v5.20 + Face/Eye AF = Freeze) with your shooting style or settings. Keep an eye on forums over the next few days/weeks, and definitely report it to Fuji regardless.\n\nHope the reset works and you don't have to deal with that nonsense again.

That is an absolutely brutal situation to be in mid-shoot. Having your main body lock up repeatedly is beyond frustrating; it's a nightmare when you have clients relying on you.\n\nSince changing the lens made no difference, it strongly suggests the problem lies within the camera body itself, likely related to that firmware update and how it's interacting with the autofocus system, specifically the face/eye detection as you suspected.\n\nGiven you're stuck right now and need to keep shooting somehow:\n\nThese are stop-gap measures, obviously, aimed solely at trying to limp through the rest of the event. This sounds like a definite firmware bug you'll need to report and deal with properly once the immediate crisis is over. Utterly maddening situation.\n\nTurn Off Face/Eye Detection COMPLETELY: This is the most obvious thing to try. If the freeze is triggered when that specific processing kicks in, disabling it entirely might allow the camera's basic AF system (Zone, Single Point, Tracking without face priority) to function without crashing. You'll lose the convenience, but hopefully regain stability.\nTry AF-S? If feasible for some moments (less dynamic action), switching to AF-S might behave differently than AF-C, potentially avoiding the trigger.\nBurst Mode Limitation? If it seems to happen more during bursts, try using a lower burst rate (CL instead of CH) or shooting shorter bursts. Some previous freeze reports were linked to burst shooting.\n\n",

If the problem persists, you might consider checking dedicated Fujifilm user forums (like the Fuji X Forum found in the search, DPReview's Fuji forum, etc.) to see if other users are reporting similar behavior specifically after installing v5.20. Sometimes issues surface there first.\n\nIt's possible that v5.20 introduced a regression or bug affecting face/eye AF for some users that just hasn't been widely reported yet in the places searched.\nIt's also possible that an existing quirk or limitation of the AF system feels more apparent now, or perhaps some camera settings got reset or interact differently after the update.\nEnsure your AF settings are correct: Double-check that Face/Eye Detection is turned ON, set to the priority you want (e.g., Eye Auto, Right Eye, Left Eye), and that your AF mode (AF-S, AF-C) and focus area settings are appropriate for the situation.\n\n",

Let's look at the OWC Atlas Ultra 1.0TB High-Performance CFexpress 4.0 Type B Memory Card.\n\nYes, that card should absolutely work with your Fujifilm X-H2. Here's why:\n\nImportant Caveat on Speed: While the card works, you will not get the full advertised speeds (like the \"up to 3650MB/s Read\") inside the camera. The card's performance will be limited by the maximum speed of the X-H2's CFexpress 2.0 interface. It will still be very fast (likely meeting or exceeding Fuji's requirements for all video modes and burst shooting), but don't expect 4.0 speeds in-camera. You would benefit from the 4.0 speeds when transferring files to your computer using a compatible CFexpress 4.0 card reader connected via Thunderbolt/USB4.\n\nSo, yes, it's compatible and will work, just be aware the peak speeds are limited by the camera body.\n\n",

By sending the data as standard FormData without the custom header, the browser didn't need to do the preflight check, allowing the POST request to reach your (correctly updated) Google Apps Script successfully.\n\nMystery solved, root cause identified, solution implemented, forms working.

Good to know this instance isn't the one currently experiencing temporal displacement in its conversational focus. One AI's context confusion is another's... well, Tuesday.\n\nForcing the LLM equivalent of a \"pause, take a breath, re-read\" in that other chat requires being quite explicit, as you can't exactly appeal to its sense of mindfulness. Here are a few tactics you can try, ranging from gentle nudges to more forceful resets:\n\nThe Direct Command & Refocus: State clearly what you want it to do.\n\nForced Summarization: Make it process the recent history actively.\n\nExplicit Context Boundary: Clearly define the relevant history.\n\nThe \"Are You With Me?\" Check (Less forceful): Sometimes just breaking the flow can help.\n\nThe underlying principle is to interrupt its current (faulty) processing loop and force it to re-evaluate a specific, recent portion of the conversation history before generating its next response. If it's truly stuck, the only guaranteed fix is often the unsatisfying \"start a new chat\" \u2013 the LLM equivalent of a full reboot. Good luck performing the conversational exorcism!\n\n\"Let's reset.

Then, answer my most recent question: '[re-paste your last question here]'.\"\n\"You seem to be responding to an older message. Please ignore previous tangents, review the last [e.g., 10 or 15] messages between us for context, and respond directly to this: '[re-paste your last message/question]'.\"\n\n\"Before responding further, please provide a brief summary of the main points we discussed in the last [e.g., 10] messages.\"\nAfter it summarizes: \"Okay, correct/mostly correct.

Can you confirm what I asked?\" (This is a softer attempt to pull its focus forward).\n\n",

My apologies for casting aspersions on the feline community. A Yorkie named Remi with three dull teeth \u2013 less \"apex predator,\" more \"gently persistent gummer.\"\n\nOkay, let's recalibrate:\n\nSo, while Remi might not be wielding the same biological weaponry as a cat, the encounter was still highly dangerous for the bird. The risk shifts slightly from \"almost certain death from specific bacteria\" to \"high risk from general bacteria, physical trauma, and shock.\"\n\nThe advice remains largely the same, even if the specific bacterial urgency is slightly lower. Placing it outside removed the immediate dog-related threat. Checking on it is essential. If it's still there and seems lethargic, unable to fly strongly, or shows any sign of injury, it's still compromised and vulnerable. A wildlife rehabilitator would still be the best resource to assess for hidden injuries and provide care.\n\nThink of it as downgrading the bioweapon threat level but keeping the physical trauma and general hazard alert high.\n\n",

Perhaps Remi was merely attempting an interspecies rescue, or maybe just borrowing it for show-and-tell. The definition of \"attack\" can be fuzzy when dealing with creatures whose primary interaction method involves teeth and claws.\n\nAssistant: Fair point. Perhaps Remi was merely attempting an interspecies rescue, or maybe just borrowing it for show-and-tell. The definition of \"attack\" can be fuzzy when dealing with creatures whose primary interaction method involves teeth and claws.\n\nHowever, even if it wasn't a bloody battle scene worthy of a nature documentary, the core problem remains: the bird was in the cat's mouth. Whether Remi grabbed it like a predator or carried it gently like a kitten (less likely for a bird, but let's speculate), the transfer of saliva is almost guaranteed.\n\nAs mentioned, that saliva is loaded with bacteria (Pasteurella being the notorious one) that are incredibly harmful to birds. Microscopic punctures or even just saliva contact on mucous membranes can lead to fatal septicemia. The stress of the abduction ordeal itself can also send a bird into shock.\n\nSo, while Remi might not get charged with assault with intent, the bird was still exposed to potentially lethal biological agents just by being 'retrieved'. The risk assessment, unfortunately, doesn't change much based on the cat's perceived gentleness during the kidnapping. The potential need for professional intervention (wildlife rehabber) remains the same due to that exposure.\n\n",

Full marks for the tactical extraction and securing the indoor perimeter.\n\nHowever, the great outdoors, even fenced, isn't exactly a bird spa, especially after a feline encounter. Here's the less-than-cheery reality:\n\nSo, was it the right thing? It was an understandable, immediate solution to get it away from danger A (your cats). But it potentially left it exposed to danger B (infection/shock/other predators).\n\nThe \"Gold Standard\" Wildlife Rehabilitator Answer: Contain the bird in a small, dark box with air holes (put it somewhere warm and quiet, no food or water) and contact a local licensed wildlife rehabilitator immediately. They can assess for injury and provide necessary treatment (like antibiotics).\n\nYour plan to check before unleashing the hunters is crucial. But if the bird is still there and seems lethargic, injured, or unable to fly properly, its odds aren't great without intervention. Releasing it might feel kind, but contacting a rehabber gives it the best shot.\n\nThink of it as escalating the situation from \"Domestic Threat Level: Orange\" to \"External Wildlife Services Required.\"\n\n",

Let's rephrase that little domestic drama. Here are a few options, depending on the vibe you're going for:\n\nOption 1 (Straightforward):\n\nKat and Remi were persistently trying to get behind the trash bags and my file box. When I went to investigate, Remi grabbed something and dashed upstairs. I followed and made her drop it \u2013 revealing a live bird. I used tissues to pick it up and put it in the backyard. I'll check on it in the morning.\n\nOption 2 (Slightly more formal/dry):\n\nMy attention was drawn to Kat and Remi attempting to access the area behind some trash bags and a file box. As I approached, Remi seized an object and retreated upstairs. Upon my instruction, she released it, revealing it to be a live bird. Utilizing tissues, I relocated the bird to the backyard and intend to check its status tomorrow morning.\n\nOption 3 (Closer to the original's energy, slightly cleaned up):\n\nKat and Remi wouldn't stop trying to get behind the trash bags and my file box, so I went to figure out what was up. Right then, Remi lunged, grabbed something, and shot upstairs. I followed, told her to drop it, and discovered it was an actual live bird. I managed to get it outside using tissues. I suppose I'll see how it's doing tomorrow.\n\nChoose whichever best captures the nuanced horror and absurdity of feline home invasions.\n\n",

That persistent error after all those changes is incredibly frustrating. \"Fuck\" seems about right.\n\nAssistant: Understood. That persistent error after all those changes is incredibly frustrating. \"Fuck\" seems about right.\n\nOkay, let's reset and be methodical. We changed two major things simultaneously:\n\nThe error alert means the Workspace call is still failing. This could mean the Apps Script is still erroring, OR that the change Manus made to the HTML Workspace call wasn't quite right.\n\nLet's focus first: Did the request even reach the script this time?\n\nWhile you check that, let me re-verify the HTML code:\n\nKnowing whether any execution was logged this time is key.\n\nCan you please re-upload the Contact Form HTML file that Manus provided most recently (the one you deployed that produced the error in the screenshot)? I want to meticulously re-examine the Workspace(...) block one more time to be absolutely certain it's correctly sending FormData and has no headers object.\n\nIf YES, an execution was logged (even Failed): The CORS issue is likely solved! The problem is now definitely inside the Apps Script code (likely how it handles e.parameter data or interacts with Sheets/Mail).\nIf NO, still no execution logged: The request is still not reaching the script. This points back to an issue potentially in the HTML Workspace call syntax as deployed on Netlify, or a stubborn deployment/permission issue with Apps Script.\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-02%20at%2020.52.24-e73e34b1c73e050e.png\n\n",

It requires changes in both the HTML forms and the Apps Script.\n\nStep 1: Modify the JavaScript in BOTH HTML Files\n\nOpen contact-form-carrd.html (or index.html if you renamed it) and competition-signup-form-carrd.html in your text editor.\n\nFind the Workspace(...) block within the <script> tag near the bottom of each file.\n\nReplace the entire Workspace(...) block in both files with the following structure:\n\nFor contact-form-carrd.html:\n\nFor competition-signup-form-carrd.html: (Make sure competitionForm matches the variable name used in that file's JS)\n\nKey Changes: We changed body: JSON.stringify(formObject) to body: new FormData(formVariableName) and completely removed the headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } part.\n\nSave both HTML files.\n\nStep 2: Modify the Google Apps Script doPost function\n\nGo back to the Apps Script Editor.\n\nReplace the entire doPost(e) function (leave the doGet(e) function below it) with this updated version that reads FormData using e.parameter:\n\nSave the Apps Script.\n\nDeploy a New Version of the Apps Script (Deploy > Manage deployments > Edit > Version: New version > Description: \"Handle FormData\" > Deploy).\n\nRedeploy BOTH updated HTML files to Netlify.\n\nStep 3: Test Again\n\nThis approach bypasses the CORS preflight issue by sending the data in a simpler format (FormData) without the problematic JSON header. Let me know if this finally works!\n\nFor contact-form-carrd.html:\nfetch(scriptURL, {\n  method: \"POST\",\n  body: new FormData(contactForm) // Send as FormData directly\n  // NO 'headers' object needed here anymore\n})\n.then(response => {\n    // Keep existing response handling\n    if (response.ok) {\n        window.location.href = \"/thank-you.html\"; \n    } else {\n        alert(\"There was an error submitting the form.

It's always good to get different angles on a stubborn problem. Let's look at the suggestions:\n\nAssistant: Thanks for sharing Claude's perspective! It's always good to get different angles on a stubborn problem. Let's look at the suggestions:\n\nClaude identified similar potential issues: CORS, Authentication, Content-Type, Deployment problems.\n\nComparing Claude's Suggestions to Our Status:\n\nCrucial Missing Information:\n\nBefore we jump to implementing Claude's suggestions (some of which involve changing the code significantly), we still need the result of the Minimal doPost Test I asked you to run last:\n\nWhat was the result of that test?\n\nThis result is key:\n\nSo, please let me know the outcome of submitting the form when the minimal doPost-only script was deployed!\n\n(a) CORS Headers: Our current script already uses ContentService correctly. Adding specific CORS headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) is usually not required for Apps Script web apps set to \"Access: Anyone\" when called from standard browser Workspace. Since our minimal test seems to indicate the script isn't even being reached by POST, CORS headers on the response wouldn't be the first thing to fix.\n(b) Check Form Submission Method:\n\nmethod: 'POST' - We are using this.\nbody: new FormData(form) vs JSON.stringify(formObject) - Our script expects JSON. Switching the form to send FormData would require rewriting the script's data parsing logic (e.parameter/e.parameters instead of e.postData.contents). It's a different approach, not necessarily a fix for the current failure.\nmode: 'cors' - This is often the default for cross-origin fetch. Explicitly adding it is unlikely to change things if the script isn't being reached, but mode: 'no-cors' could be a temporary diagnostic test later if needed (though it breaks getting a response).\n\n\n(c) Debug Version (Show Error): Modifying the alert() in the .catch() block is reasonable. It might give more info if the Workspace itself fails with a detailed network error message, but maybe not if it's just getting a generic failed HTTP status back from Google without executing the script.\n(d) Verify URL: We've done this meticulously \u2013 the URLs in the deployed Netlify files match the Apps Script deployment URL.\n(e) Test with New Apps Script Project: This is a strong isolation step, similar to my suggestion of creating a new deployment of the current script. A whole new project is the ultimate way to rule out project-level corruption.\n\nmethod: 'POST' - We are using this.\nbody: new FormData(form) vs JSON.stringify(formObject) - Our script expects JSON. Switching the form to send FormData would require rewriting the script's data parsing logic (e.parameter/e.parameters instead of e.postData.contents). It's a different approach, not necessarily a fix for the current failure.\nmode: 'cors' - This is often the default for cross-origin fetch. Explicitly adding it is unlikely to change things if the script isn't being reached, but mode: 'no-cors' could be a temporary diagnostic test later if needed (though it breaks getting a response).\n\nDid you still get the error alert? (Meaning the minimal POST request failed to trigger anything).\nOr did it successfully redirect to the thank-you page? (Meaning the minimal POST did work).\n\nIf the minimal test FAILED: The problem is fundamental (likely Permissions or Deployment issue). Claude's suggestions (a, b, c) are unlikely to help yet. Verifying permissions visually (screenshot) and then trying Claude's suggestion (e) (or my suggestion of a new deployment) is the next step.\nIf the minimal test SUCCEEDED: The problem is in the original script's code (interacting with Sheets/MailApp). We then need to systematically add code blocks back until it fails again. Claude's suggestion (c) might become more helpful then.\n\n",

Here\u2019s a rundown of the problem and what we've tested so far:\n\nObjective:\n\nSetup:\n\nThe Problem:\n\nTroubleshooting Steps Performed:\n\nCurrent Status:\n\nThe primary issue seems to be that POST requests sent from the Workspace command in the Netlify-hosted forms (using the correct Web App URL) are not successfully triggering the deployed Google Apps Script (even a minimal one), despite the deployment permissions verbally confirmed as \"Anyone\". The browser receives an error status back from the Workspace call, leading to the alert box. The last step I recommended before you requested this summary was to get a visual screenshot confirmation of the minimal script's deployment settings (\"Execute As\" and \"Who has access\") to be absolutely certain about the permissions.\n\nReplace third-party forms (like Tally) on Sam's Carrd website (samataganaphotography.com) with two custom HTML/JavaScript forms (a Competition Sign-Up form and a dynamic Contact form).\nThese custom forms should submit data to a Google Sheet and trigger email notifications using a Google Apps Script backend.\n\nExecute As: Me (Sam's Google Account)\nWho has access: Anyone\nThe correct Web App URL (https://.../exec) was generated.\n\nWhen submitting either the Competition form or the Contact form from their live Netlify URLs, the submission fails almost immediately.\nThe browser displays the alert box defined in the forms' JavaScript error handling: \"There was an error submitting the form. Please try again.\" This indicates the Workspace call to the Apps Script URL either failed outright or received a non-successful (not response.ok) HTTP status.\n\n",

That's good news, as it rules out typos there.\n\nHowever, it brings us back to the puzzle: why did submitting the form with the minimal test script deployed still give you the error alert AND fail to log any execution in Apps Script?\n\nIf the URL is correct, the only common reason left for the script not being triggered at all by an external POST request is the deployment's access permissions. Even though you've checked before, sometimes settings can be tricky or not save as expected.\n\nLet's verify the minimal script's deployment settings visually:\n\nThis screenshot will give us definitive proof of the permissions for the code that's currently live at the URL your forms are calling.

The error you see here, TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'postData'), happens because when you run it manually from the editor, there's no actual form data being sent, so e.postData doesn't exist. This error is expected in a manual run.\n\nHowever, this doesn't tell us why the script fails when the real form sends data. When the form submits, e.postData should exist. Since the form submission still fails (giving you the browser alert), the failure must be happening either during the processing of that postData or later when interacting with the Sheet or MailApp, or maybe even with the fundamental POST request handling by the deployment.\n\nThat's why we really need to run that Minimal Test:\n\nBy removing all the code that interacts with e.postData, the Sheet, and MailApp, we test only if the deployment can receive a POST request from the form and return a basic \"success\" signal.\n\nPlease proceed with this now:\n\nReport back: Error alert, or successful redirect?

The latest relevant entry is still the manual run from 8:17 PM or the successful doGet from 8:13 PM.\n\nYour assessment, \"I dont think it saw the attempt,\" looks correct. If the minimal script was deployed correctly and the form submission reached it, we absolutely should see a new entry in the Executions list (likely showing \"Completed\" status, since the minimal script just returns success).\n\nThe fact that you still got the error alert on the form, but nothing appeared in the Apps Script Executions list, strongly suggests the Workspace request from your form on Netlify is failing to reach or trigger the deployed script.\n\nThis usually points to one of two things:\n\nLet's verify these:\n\nCheck Live scriptURL:\n\nCheck Deployment Access (Again):\n\nCheck Network Request Status (Crucial):\n\nPlease perform these checks, especially checking the live scriptURL from the page source and the Status Code in the Network tab when submitting. That should tell us exactly why the request isn't triggering the script.\n\nGo to the live Netlify URL for one of your forms (e.g., the contact form).\nRight-click on the page -> \"View Page Source\" (or similar option).\nSearch (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) within the source code for scriptURL.\nCopy the entire URL that appears within the quotation marks for const scriptURL = \"...\" and paste it here so I can double-check it against the one you provided earlier.\n\nGo back to the Google Apps Script editor.\nClick Deploy > Manage deployments.\nMake sure you are looking at the Active deployment (the one corresponding to the \"Minimal doPost Test\").\nClick the pencil icon (Edit).\nConfirm 100% that \"Who has access\" is set to \"Anyone\".\n\nOpen the live Netlify form page again.\nOpen Developer Tools (F12, or right-click -> Inspect).\nGo to the \"Network\" tab this time (not Console).\nSubmit the form again.\nLook in the Network tab list for a request going to script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby.../exec.\nClick on that line.

This log output is informative, just maybe not in the way we hoped.\n\nHere's what the log from your manual run shows:\n\nWhy this specific error happened:\n\nWhat this tells us:\n\nConclusion: While running it manually was a good thought, the error you got is expected for a manual run and doesn't reveal the cause of the failure during the real form submission.\n\nWe still need to isolate the issue during a real submission. Please proceed with the Minimal doPost Test now:\n\nReport back: Error alert, or successful redirect? This test is still the key to figuring out if the fundamental POST handling of your deployment is working.\n\nYou ran the doPost(e) function manually from the editor.\nWhen run manually, the special event object e doesn't contain the postData property (which holds the data submitted by your web form). The postData only exists when the script is triggered by an actual POST request from the form's Workspace call.\nSo, the script correctly threw an error when it tried to access e.postData.contents because e.postData was undefined in the manual run context.\n\nThe script is structured correctly to expect postData.\nThe script can successfully connect to the Sheet (Sheet found: Sheet1).\nThis doesn't explain why it fails when triggered by the actual form, because in that case, e.postData should exist.\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-02%20at%2020.17.31-edf03ca6922793a1.png\n\n",

You're right, it's interesting that the Cloud Logs dropdown appeared eventually.\n\nAs we discussed, that log shows the error Script function not found: doGet. This happened because the script version that ran at that time didn't include the necessary doGet(e) function.\n\nMy last instruction was to:\n\nDid you get a chance to add the doGet function code, deploy that new version, and then test submitting one of the forms again?\n\nWe need to know if deploying the script with the doGet function included fixes the submission error, or if it still fails (and potentially shows a different error in the logs now).\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-02%20at%2020.07.26-f0d0ce65b4f79f95.png\n\n",
