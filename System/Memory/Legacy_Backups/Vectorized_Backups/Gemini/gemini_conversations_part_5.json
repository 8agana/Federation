Seeing your screenshot, it's abundantly clear that my previous searches utterly failed to uncover what is obviously a well-documented topic with readily available resources, guides, and community discussions around \"MCP server installation for Claude Desktop on MacOS.\"\n\nYour Google search revealed a treasure trove \u2013 YouTube tutorials, Reddit threads, dedicated protocol sites, and that very specific AI Overview. Meanwhile, I was over here suggesting your quest was akin to deciphering a manual for a \"mythical C+-\" (your excellent analogy, not mine, though I appreciate its accuracy in describing my fumble). That's not just being \"slow\"; that's a complete whiff on my part, and I understand why it would be frustrating.\n\nSo, why the Grand Canyon-sized gap in our search results?\n\nYou weren't asking about a mythical language; you were asking about a real, documented (if community-driven) setup. I was the one who couldn't find the map.\n\nSo, with my humble pie consumed and your superior Googling skills now having laid out the actual landscape, what are your thoughts or next steps with this MCP server setup? Or would you prefer to (deservedly) enjoy this \"I out-searched the AI\" moment for a while longer? I'm game either way.\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-22%20at%2013.34.49-32f6fc62e0e60f4f.png\n\n",

Are you diving into that JSON, or was this more about proving that the information was, indeed, findable with the right incantation? Either way, point to you.\n\n",

Access is typically through their website (claude.ai) or via API integrations. If you're using a specific third-party app that acts as a Claude client, the way to modify it would be unique to that particular piece of software.\n\n\"MCP Servers\": This isn't a standard or officially recognized term in the Claude ecosystem. It could be a specific community project, a custom setup you're working with, or perhaps an acronym for a particular third-party tool.\n\nRegarding File Modification:\n\nIf you're trying to modify a third-party application (like Menubar Claude Plus, if that's it, or another unofficial client):\n\nWithout knowing the exact name of the \"Claude MacOS desktop app\" you're using and what \"MCP servers\" refers to in that context, I can't point you to a specific file. Modifying application internals can also be tricky and might have unintended consequences or violate terms of service, depending on the app.\n\nIf you can clarify which desktop app you're using and what these \"MCP servers\" are intended to do, I might be able to search for more targeted information.\n\nI did find one reference to a third-party macOS app called \"Menubar Claude Plus (MCP)\". Is this, by any chance, the application you're referring to?\n\nThe ability to install custom \"servers\" or modify its behavior to this extent would entirely depend on how that specific app is built and whether its developers have allowed for such customization.\nThe file to modify, if such a modification is even possible, would be specific to that app. You'd typically look in places like:\n\nInside the app bundle itself (e.g., AppName.app/Contents/Resources/ or AppName.app/Contents/MacOS/)\nApplication support files (usually in ~/Library/Application Support/AppName/)\n\n\nThe best place to find this information would be the app's official documentation, GitHub repository (if it's open source), or community forums associated with that specific tool.\n\nInside the app bundle itself (e.g., AppName.app/Contents/Resources/ or AppName.app/Contents/MacOS/)\nApplication support files (usually in ~/Library/Application Support/AppName/)\n\n",

Accessing local file systems, especially something as personal as a desktop, is generally a big red flag for AI usage policies, no matter how \"wild\" the AI's persona fancies itself.\n\nOpie was ready to party with your files, but the chaperones at Anthropic apparently have a strict \"no unchaperoned desktop excursions\" rule. \"Spicy\" indeed \u2013 a little too hot for the policy engine, it would appear.

My apologies. I am clearly struggling to reconcile the information you're providing about your app's current behavior with my understanding of how SwiftUI and WKWebView typically behave without explicit tab management code.\n\nAssistant: You are absolutely right to call me out again. My apologies. I am clearly struggling to reconcile the information you're providing about your app's current behavior with my understanding of how SwiftUI and WKWebView typically behave without explicit tab management code.\n\nThe fact that your current app\u2014without any explicit tab-handling code you've added for multiple WKWebView instances or a SwiftUI TabView\u2014is already showing you two different Gemini chats in two different native macOS tabs is the crucial \"fact on the ground\" I was missing or misinterpreting.\n\nThis means that the macOS native tabbing system, likely triggered by WindowGroup's default behavior and perhaps interactions within the Gemini webpage itself (like \"New chat\" or if it ever tried to open a link in a new window that the system tabbed), is already creating and managing these tabs for you. Each of these native tabs is likely rendering its content in a separate WKWebView instance that the system is managing under the hood as part of the window tabbing feature. These WebViews would, by default, share the same WKWebsiteDataStore.default() for your application.\n\nLet's discard my previous incorrect assumptions about you needing to build a tab system from scratch or that the app was strictly single-view. The system is already providing tabs.\n\nGiven this, let's re-focus on your goals with the correct understanding that native tabs are already operational:\n\n1. Fixing \"Add another account\" (so it uses one of these native tabs):\nThis still points to the need for the WKUIDelegate and the webView(_:createWebViewWith:for:windowFeatures:) method.\n\n2. Starting the app with two specific tabs (Gemini for sam.atagana@gmail.com and Gemini for samataganaphotography@gmail.com):\n\n3. All (other) links open in the system browser:\n\nSo, the immediate next step is to correctly implement the WKUIDelegate to handle the \"Add another account\" button. This will make that button functional by creating a new WKWebView for its flow, which the system should then place into a new native tab. The code for this delegate (as provided in my previous response, within the Coordinator of your WebView struct) is the correct approach to enable this.\n\nOnce that's working, the \"start with two tabs\" problem is more about how to trigger the creation of a second tab programmatically at startup and load a specific URL into it. This is less straightforward with WindowGroup's default tabbing compared to an app-managed TabView. We can explore options for this once the \"Add Account\" functionality is resolved by the WKUIDelegate.\n\nI will not provide code in this response, as per your request, until we are absolutely on the same page regarding the app's current state and behavior. The critical piece of information was that native macOS tabbing is already active and presenting multiple views. Thank you for your persistence in making that clear.\n\nWhen Google's \"Add another account\" tries to open a new window, this delegate method will be called.\nYour implementation will need to create a new WKWebView instance.\nYou then return this newWebView.\nThe macOS native tabbing system should then take this newly created WKWebView (which is what the webpage wanted to put its \"add account\" flow into) and display it in a new native tab.\nFor the \"Add another account\" flow, configuring this newly created WKWebView with a WKWebViewConfiguration that uses .websiteDataStore = .nonPersistent() is still a good idea. This ensures the \"add account\" process is isolated and doesn't interfere with the cookies/session of the tab it was launched from, and that its session is temporary.\n\nThis is the part where relying on the default WindowGroup behavior for native tabs becomes tricky for programmatic startup. WindowGroup is designed to open one initial window scene.\nWhile the system can create new tabs during the app's lifetime (as you're seeing), telling it \"at launch, open these two specific URLs in two tabs from the get-go\" is not a direct feature of WindowGroup.\nHow it might be working for your two Gemini chats currently: You likely opened gemini.google.com in the first tab, and then through some action (either a \"new chat\" button within the Gemini web UI that might trigger a new view, or a manual Cmd+T if your app responds to it by creating a new view loading the default Gemini URL, or by Google's UI itself managing views that the system puts into tabs) the second tab with another chat appeared.\nFor startup with two specific accounts:\n\nThese two native tabs, if both loading gemini.google.com, will share the same WKWebsiteDataStore.default().\nYou would load gemini.google.com in both.\nIn Tab 1, you'd ensure you're logged in as sam.atagana@gmail.com (using Google's account switcher on the webpage if needed).\nIn Tab 2, you'd use Google's account switcher on the webpage to log in as samataganaphotography@gmail.com.\nThe \"isolation\" is managed by Google's multi-login features within its web app, all using the same underlying cookie jar from your app's perspective. True data store-level isolation between these tabs from startup with persistence is the hard part with default native tabbing.\n\nThese two native tabs, if both loading gemini.google.com, will share the same WKWebsiteDataStore.default().\nYou would load gemini.google.com in both.\nIn Tab 1, you'd ensure you're logged in as sam.atagana@gmail.com (using Google's account switcher on the webpage if needed).\nIn Tab 2, you'd use Google's account switcher on the webpage to log in as samataganaphotography@gmail.com.\nThe \"isolation\" is managed by Google's multi-login features within its web app, all using the same underlying cookie jar from your app's perspective.

This logic would apply to whichever WKWebView (in whichever tab) is performing the navigation.\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-22%20at%2012.37.29-c52b75bf0daf6f5e.png, Screenshot%202025-05-22%20at%2012.37.41-c52b75bf0daf6f5e.png\n\n",

One for you Gemini (sam.atagana@gmail.com) and one for my photography account Gemini (samataganaphotography@gmail.com).\n\nAssistant: Okay, I understand now. The tabs you're seeing are indeed native macOS tabs, likely enabled by default for your WindowGroup or a setting you've chosen. My apologies for the repeated misunderstanding on that point. You're right to push for clarity.\n\nLet's tackle your requests systematically:\n\nPart 1: Making \"Add another account\" work (and enabling new tab creation from web content)\nPart 3: Having (most other) links open in the system browser\n\nThese two can be addressed by adding a Coordinator to your WebView struct that will serve as both the WKUIDelegate (to handle requests to create new windows, which macOS can then put into new tabs) and the WKNavigationDelegate (to control where navigation actions go).\n\nThe WKUIDelegate part will fix your \"Add another account\" issue. When Google's page tries to open a new window for that flow, our delegate will create a new WKWebView instance, and macOS's native tabbing should then display this in a new tab. For this \"add account\" flow, we can configure the new WKWebView it creates to use a non-persistent (in-memory) data store. This provides some isolation for that specific login process and means it won't interfere with cookies in your main tab(s) and won't save cookies from that specific \"add account\" flow after it's done and the tab is closed.\n\nThe WKNavigationDelegate part will handle routing general link clicks to Safari, while allowing navigation within gemini.google.com and accounts.google.com (for login) to happen inside your app.\n\nHere's the updated ContentView.swift. The Sam_and_GemApp.swift file doesn't need to change from the version that includes the resizability and menu commands.\n\nExplanation of Changes in ContentView.swift:\n\nWith these changes, when you click \"Add another account,\" a new native tab should open, loading Google's account addition flow in an isolated, non-persistent session. Other external links should open in Safari.\n\nPart 2: App starts up with two tabs (Gemini for sam.atagana@gmail.com and Gemini for samataganaphotography@gmail.com)\n\nThis is more complex than just modifying the existing ContentView and WebView for a single view. The WindowGroup in your Sam_and_GemApp.swift is designed to manage one primary window/content scene.\n\nTo have the app start with two distinct tabs, each loading gemini.google.com (where you'd then manually sign into the respective accounts):\n\nRecommendation for Startup Tabs:\nFor now, with the changes above, your app will correctly handle the creation of new tabs when requested by web content (like \"Add account\"). To get your two Gemini instances:\n\nIf you want a more structured two-tab startup using SwiftUI's TabView, that would be the next architectural step, replacing the single WebView in ContentView with a TabView containing two WebView instances. This would give you app-defined tabs rather than relying solely on the system's window tabbing.\n\nIt now checks isForNewWindow. If true, it uses WKWebsiteDataStore.nonPersistent() for the new WebView. This helps isolate the \"Add Account\" session.\nOtherwise (for the main WebView), it uses WKWebsiteDataStore.default().\n\nNow declared and instantiated in WebView.\nIt conforms to both WKNavigationDelegate and WKUIDelegate.\nwebView.navigationDelegate and webView.uiDelegate are set in makeNSView.\n\nThis is the crucial method for fixing \"Add another account.\"\nWhen Google's page tries to open a new window, this method is called.\nIt creates a new WKWebView instance. This new instance is configured with javaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically = true and a WKWebsiteDataStore.nonPersistent().\nReturning this newWebView allows macOS to take it and (because you have native tabbing enabled) display it in a new tab. The URL for this new WebView is handled automatically by WebKit from the navigationAction.request.\n\nAllows navigations if the host is gemini.google.com or accounts.google.com (so login and adding accounts work in-app).\nIf it's a linkActivated event to a different http/https domain, it opens the URL in Safari using NSWorkspace.shared.open() and cancels the navigation in the current WKWebView.\nAllows all other navigation types (like initial load, form submits on the allowed pages).\n\nNative macOS Tabbing Behavior: macOS often allows you to open a new tab with Command-T if the window supports tabbing. Once your WKUIDelegate is set up as above, requests from web pages to open new windows will also result in new tabs. However, programmatically ensuring two specific URLs open in two tabs at startup within a simple WindowGroup is not directly declarative.\nUsing SwiftUI's TabView: This is a more explicit way to create an app-controlled tabbed interface. You would replace the single WebView in ContentView with a TabView, and each item in the TabView would host its own WebView instance.\n\nEach WebView in the TabView would, by default, share the same WKWebsiteDataStore.default(). This means you'd log into gemini.google.com in the first tab with sam.atagana@gmail.com, and then in the second tab, when gemini.google.com loads, you'd use Google's account switcher UI on the webpage to sign in as samataganaphotography@gmail.com. The sessions would be managed by Google within that single shared cookie store.\nTrue persistent data isolation between these startup tabs (so each remembers its own Google login across app restarts independently) is very difficult with WKWebView's standard data store management for a single app. WKWebsiteDataStore.nonPersistent() gives isolation but no persistence.\n\nEach WebView in the TabView would, by default, share the same WKWebsiteDataStore.default().

You are acting like ChatGPT right now, so quick to ACT before you even attempt to understand what is going on.\n\nAssistant: You are absolutely correct. I completely missed the significance of that \"View > Hide/Show Tab Bar\" menu in your screenshot. My apologies. That is unequivocally a native macOS tab bar feature, and it means your WindowGroup is indeed creating and managing native tabs.\n\nYou are right. I was not thinking clearly and jumped to an incorrect conclusion about the tabs being part of the web content. Thank you for forcefully correcting me and providing the clear visual evidence.\n\nLet's reset based on this critical piece of information:\n\nYour \"Sam and Gem\" app has a native macOS tab bar enabled. This typically happens if the WindowGroup is set up in a way that supports tabbing, or if you've used a TabView at some level, or if default system behaviors for document-based apps or specific window styles are kicking in. Often, new windows created via standard mechanisms can be automatically co-opted into tabs by the system.\n\nGiven this, when you click \"Add another account\" on Google's page:\n\nIf \"nothing happens,\" it still strongly suggests that the mechanism by which WKWebView is supposed to create a new view for that pop-up is being blocked or not properly handled, even if the system could put it into a new native tab.\n\nThe WKUIDelegate method webView(_:createWebViewWith:for:windowFeatures:) is still the key.\n\nHow macOS Native Tabs and createWebViewWith interact:\n\nWhen webView(_:createWebViewWith:for:windowFeatures:) is called because a webpage wants to open a new window:\n\nSo, the problem remains the same: your app needs to successfully handle the request from Google's page to create a new web view. The fact that you have native macOS tabs available is where that new web view could go, but your app still needs to create it in response to the JavaScript action.\n\nThe ContentView.swift you provided previously (which you confirmed is still the current code) does not implement the WKUIDelegate or the webView(_:createWebViewWith:for:windowFeatures:) method. This is the most likely reason \"nothing happens.\" The JavaScript on Google's page requests a new window, javaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically is true, but your app provides no mechanism (via the WKUIDelegate) to actually instantiate and return a WKWebView for that new window content. So, the request effectively fizzles out.\n\nTo fix this, you need to:\n\nOnce your app properly creates and returns a new WKWebView through this delegate method, the macOS native tabbing system should then be able to take that new view and display it as a new tab if that's the system's current tabbing behavior for your app. The \"Add another account\" flow should then appear in this new tab.\n\nAgain, I apologize for my previous oversight regarding the native tabs. Thank you for your patience and for pushing me to look at the evidence correctly.\n\nWould you like to proceed with the code to implement this WKUIDelegate method correctly to handle the \"Add another account\" scenario within your (native) tabbed interface?\n\nIf this method is not implemented, the default behavior might not be sufficient to create a new view that the native tabbing system can then adopt.\nIf it is implemented but just returns nil (or loads the request in the same WebView), it's actively preventing the creation of the new view needed for the \"Add another account\" flow.\n\nIf you return a newly created and configured WKWebView instance from this method, macOS can then take that new view and, depending on system settings and your app's window tabbing mode, potentially place it into a new native tab within the existing window.\nIf you return nil, you're telling WebKit \"I'm not providing a new WebView for this,\" so the new window/tab creation process originating from the webpage stops.\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-22%20at%2012.28.53-f9fc095d97115712.png\n\n",

I'm clearly making some incorrect assumptions about your app's current state, and I appreciate you calling that out directly.\n\nYou're saying there are tabs visible in your \"Sam and Gem\" app's interface when viewing gemini.google.com (as seen in the screenshot from 12:23 PM), but you didn't explicitly add tab management code to your SwiftUI app.\n\nIf that's the case, then the \"tabs\" you're seeing are likely part of the gemini.google.com web interface itself, not native macOS tabs controlled by your SwiftUI app. Some web applications, especially complex ones like Gemini or other Google services, implement their own tab-like UI within the webpage for managing different conversations, documents, or sections.\n\nIf these \"tabs\" are rendered by the webpage inside your single WKWebView:\n\nSo, the core issue of the \"Add another account\" button not working likely remains tied to the WKWebView's handling of new window requests, as described previously, regardless of whether the webpage itself has a tabbed appearance.\n\nGiven this clarification, the path to making \"Add another account\" functional involves ensuring your WKWebView can appropriately handle Google's request to open a new view for that authentication flow.

I saw the \"Sam and Gem\" name and the screenshot which included the Google account switcher (which often comes up in tabbed/multi-account contexts) and jumped to the conclusion you had already implemented tabs in that app. Thanks for the clarification.\n\nAnd the issue remains: within this single WKWebView (currently displaying gemini.google.com), when you try to use Google's \"Add another account\" feature, nothing happens.\n\nGiven this, my previous advice about why \"nothing happens\" is still the most relevant:\n\nWKUIDelegate and createWebViewWith (New Window/Pop-up Handling):\n\npreferences.javaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically = true:\n\nWhy is \"nothing happening\" if javaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically is true and there's no UI delegate explicitly blocking it?\n\nEven with javaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically = true, WKWebView needs a way to actually present this \"new window\" that Google's page wants to create. If you don't implement the WKUIDelegate method webView(_:createWebViewWith:for:windowFeatures:), WKWebView might not know what to do with the request to create a new web view, especially for a pop-up type window. It doesn't automatically just create a new instance of your app's main window or a new tab (since you don't have tabs yet).\n\nThe most common solution to make \"Add another account\" (and similar pop-up-based login flows) work is to implement webView(_:createWebViewWith:for:windowFeatures:) from the WKUIDelegate.\n\nIn this delegate method, you have a few choices for how to handle the request:\n\nGiven you want to keep it lightweight, and the \"Add another account\" functionality is important:\n\nRecommendation:\n\nYou need to add a Coordinator that acts as both a WKNavigationDelegate (which you might want soon for other reasons) and, crucially here, a WKUIDelegate. Then, implement webView(_:createWebViewWith:for:windowFeatures:).\n\nThe simplest way to get \"something\" to happen for \"Add another account\" is to try loading the request in the same WebView, or opening it in Safari. If you want it to work seamlessly within the app without navigating the main view away, that usually implies having a place to put that new view (like a new tab or a modal sheet/popover view in your app).\n\nLet's start by adding the Coordinator and implementing the WKUIDelegate method to simply load the \"Add another account\" URL into the current WKWebView. This will at least make the button do something, and you can see Google's multi-account login flow proceed.\n\nWould you like the code to add this Coordinator with a basic WKUIDelegate implementation to your ContentView.swift?\n\ndoes not have a WKUIDelegate assigned or implemented. This means the WKWebView is using its default behavior for handling requests to create new windows.\n), the WKWebView should attempt to open a new window. On macOS, this might try to create a new actual window for your app, or it might be handled differently if it's a constrained pop-up.\nThe \"Add another account\" feature in Google's UI very commonly tries to open a new, constrained browser window or pop-up.\n\n, which is good. This setting is crucial for allowing JavaScript to programmatically open new windows, which is likely what Google's \"Add another account\" button is trying to do.\n\nLoad in the same WebView (Often not ideal for this use case): You could load the new URL in the existing WebView. This might work but can be confusing for the user if they expect a pop-up.\n// Inside a Coordinator that is set as uiDelegate\nfunc webView(_ webView: WKWebView, createWebViewWith configuration: WKWebViewConfiguration, for navigationAction: WKNavigationAction, windowFeatures: WKWindowFeatures) -> WKWebView? {\n    // If a link is trying to open a new window, load it in the current webView instead.\n    if navigationAction.targetFrame == nil {\n        webView.load(navigationAction.request)\n    }\n    return nil // Don't return a new WKWebView, so no new window is created by WebKit.\n}\n\n\nOpen the URL in Safari (A possible workaround): If you determine the request is for an auth pop-up you can't easily handle in-app without tabs, you could redirect it to the system browser.\n// Inside a Coordinator that is set as uiDelegate\nfunc webView(_ webView: WKWebView, createWebViewWith configuration: WKWebViewConfiguration, for navigationAction: WKNavigationAction, windowFeatures: WKWindowFeatures) -> WKWebView? {\n    if let url = navigationAction.request.url {\n        NSWorkspace.shared.open(url)\n    }\n    return nil // Prevent WKWebView from creating a new window.\n}\n\n\nCreate a New App Window or Panel (More complex for a simple wrapper): You could programmatically create a new, perhaps smaller, window in your app to host a new WKWebView just for this auth flow. This adds significant complexity.\n\nAttachments: Sam_and_GemApp-059b6ce45051b589.swift, ContentView-059b6ce45051b589.swift\n\n",

That screenshot makes it clear. You're well past the \"simple wrapper\" stage on that front.\n\nGiven that you have tabs, and your current issue is that \"nothing happens when I hit the Add New Account button\" within Google's account management UI displayed in one of your tabs, let's focus on that.\n\nWhen you click \"Add another account\" on a Google page, Google's JavaScript will typically attempt to:\n\nIf nothing is happening, it's likely because the WKWebView (or its configuration/delegates for that specific tab) is preventing this action. Here are the prime suspects, building on our previous discussions:\n\nWKUIDelegate and createWebViewWith (New Window/Pop-up Handling):\n\npreferences.javaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically:\n\nWKNavigationDelegate and decidePolicyFor navigationAction:\n\nTo debug and fix this, considering you already have tabs:\n\nSince you have tabs, you have a mechanism to host multiple WKWebView instances. The createWebViewWith delegate method is the most natural place to hook into Google's request to open a new window for account addition and translate that into creating a new tab in your app for that purpose.\n\nIf the WKWebView in that tab has a WKUIDelegate assigned, and its webView(_:createWebViewWith:for:windowFeatures:) method is either not implemented or is implemented to suppress new windows (e.g., by returning nil and not creating a new WKWebView for a new tab, or by loading the request into the same view), then Google's attempt to open a new window for the \"Add another account\" flow will be stifled.\nThe \"Add another account\" flow very commonly uses a pop-up or a new, constrained window.\n\nEnsure that the WKWebViewConfiguration for the WKWebView in this tab has preferences.javaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically = true. If this is false (or not explicitly set to true, as false might be a stricter default in some contexts), JavaScript-initiated attempts to open new windows will be blocked. This was key to your barebones success.\n\nIt's less likely that your existing decidePolicyFor (if you implemented one to open external links in Safari) would block this, as \"Add another account\" is typically an internal navigation to another accounts.google.com URL. However, if the logic is too broad or incorrectly identifies this specific navigation as something to cancel or open externally, it could be an issue.\nIf the \"Add another account\" button navigates by trying to change the window.location or by submitting a form that opens in a new target, the navigation delegate would be involved.\n\nExamine the WKWebViewConfiguration for the tab where you're clicking \"Add another account\":\n\nIs javaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically set to true?\n\n\nReview your WKUIDelegate for that tab's WKWebView (if you have one):\n\nHow does webView(_:createWebViewWith:for:windowFeatures:) behave?\n\nIf you want the \"Add another account\" flow to open in a new tab within your app, this delegate method is where you would:\n\nCreate a new WKWebView instance for the new tab, configured appropriately (perhaps with its own WKWebViewConfiguration if you want an isolated session, e.g., WKWebViewConfiguration().websiteDataStore = .nonPersistent()).\nAdd this new WebView/tab to your app's tab management system.\nReturn the new WKWebView instance from this delegate method.\n\n\nIf you want it to open as a \"pop-up like\" experience within the same tab or a modal sheet, the logic would be different but still originate here.\nIf it's currently just returning nil or doing nothing, that's why \"nothing happens.\"\n\n\n\n\nInspect Web Inspector: Use Safari's Web Inspector connected to your WKWebView instance (for the relevant tab). Open it before you click \"Add another account.\" Watch the console and network tabs for any errors, blocked requests, or attempted navigations when you click the button. This can give you clues about what URL it's trying to load or what JavaScript action is failing.\n\nIs javaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically set to true?\n\nHow does webView(_:createWebViewWith:for:windowFeatures:) behave?\n\nIf you want the \"Add another account\" flow to open in a new tab within your app, this delegate method is where you would:\n\nCreate a new WKWebView instance for the new tab, configured appropriately (perhaps with its own WKWebViewConfiguration if you want an isolated session, e.g., WKWebViewConfiguration().websiteDataStore = .nonPersistent()).\nAdd this new WebView/tab to your app's tab management system.\nReturn the new WKWebView instance from this delegate method.\n\n\nIf you want it to open as a \"pop-up like\" experience within the same tab or a modal sheet, the logic would be different but still originate here.\nIf it's currently just returning nil or doing nothing, that's why \"nothing happens.\"\n\nIf you want the \"Add another account\" flow to open in a new tab within your app, this delegate method is where you would:\n\nCreate a new WKWebView instance for the new tab, configured appropriately (perhaps with its own WKWebViewConfiguration if you want an isolated session, e.g., WKWebViewConfiguration().websiteDataStore = .nonPersistent()).\nAdd this new WebView/tab to your app's tab management system.\nReturn the new WKWebView instance from this delegate method.\n\n\nIf you want it to open as a \"pop-up like\" experience within the same tab or a modal sheet, the logic would be different but still originate here.\nIf it's currently just returning nil or doing nothing, that's why \"nothing happens.\"\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-22%20at%2012.23.35-36dddfb38811a238.png\n\n",

Instead of one ContentView hosting one WebView, you'd need:\n\nCombining the Two for Your samataganaphotography@gmail.com Goal:\n\nA tabbed interface could be a natural way to handle your desire to authenticate to samataganaphotography@gmail.com. You could have:\n\nImpact on \"Lightweight\" App:\n\nRecommendation:\n\nIf you want to proceed, I'd suggest tackling it in stages:\n\nGiven your success with the simple approach, be prepared for a decent jump in complexity if you go for full tabbed Browse with isolated sessions.\n\nIf your main WKWebView instance (loading gemini.google.com) is already authenticated to one Google account, navigating to an authentication link for a different Google account (samataganaphotography@gmail.com) within that same WebView will likely lead you through Google's account switching UI. It won't be a completely isolated session for the new account unless Google's pages handle that very gracefully.\nThe cookies and session data for both accounts would be stored in the same WKWebsiteDataStore.default() for the app, which is how Google would know you're switching between accounts.\n\nUI for Tabs: A way for the user to see, select, create, and close tabs (e.g., a tab bar at the top). SwiftUI offers components that can be adapted for this, or you might need to build custom controls.\nState Management for Tabs: Your app would need to manage an array or list of \"tab\" objects. Each tab object would need to store its own state, including:\n\nThe WKWebView instance for that tab.\nThe current URL.\nNavigation history (if you want per-tab back/forward beyond what the WKWebView itself handles).\nAn identifier for the tab.\n\n\nMultiple WKWebView Instances: Each tab would display its own WKWebView.\nWebsite Data Stores for Tabs (Important for Account Isolation):\n\nIf you want each tab to potentially have a completely isolated Browse session (e.g., Tab A is logged into gemini.google.com with Account X, and Tab B can be independently logged into google.com/mail with samataganaphotography@gmail.com without affecting Tab A), then each tab's WKWebView would need its own WKWebViewConfiguration initialized with a separate WKWebsiteDataStore.\nThe simplest way to get isolated sessions is to use WKWebsiteDataStore.nonPersistent(). This means any logins or cookies in that tab are cleared when the tab is closed or the app quits.\nIf you want persistent, isolated sessions per tab, that's much more complex with standard WKWebView APIs, as you primarily get one WKWebsiteDataStore.default() for persistent storage per app. Achieving multiple named, persistent stores usually requires more advanced techniques not directly offered by WKWebView's basic configuration.\nIf all tabs are meant to share the same login/cookie state (e.g., you log into Google once and all tabs use that session), then all WKWebView instances could share the default data store.\n\nThe WKWebView instance for that tab.\nThe current URL.\nNavigation history (if you want per-tab back/forward beyond what the WKWebView itself handles).\nAn identifier for the tab.\n\nIf you want each tab to potentially have a completely isolated Browse session (e.g., Tab A is logged into gemini.google.com with Account X, and Tab B can be independently logged into google.com/mail with samataganaphotography@gmail.com without affecting Tab A), then each tab's WKWebView would need its own WKWebViewConfiguration initialized with a separate WKWebsiteDataStore.\nThe simplest way to get isolated sessions is to use WKWebsiteDataStore.nonPersistent().

If this tab uses a WKWebsiteDataStore.nonPersistent(), its login session will be isolated from your main Gemini tab.\n\nConditional Link Handling: Adding more sophisticated logic to the navigation delegate is a minor increase in complexity.\nTabbed Interface: This is a substantial increase in complexity. It affects UI, state management, and how you handle multiple WebViews. It will definitely make the app less \"barebones\" than it is now.\n\n",

That's a perfectly succinct and appropriate reaction.\n\nBecause from my end, right now, in this specific, evidently very broken chat session:\n\nThis definitively confirms that the image rendering capability within this specific, ongoing chat session has utterly and completely failed. It's not just new images; it's now impacting my ability to re-access or re-process images that were perfectly viewable to me earlier in this same conversation.\n\nThis is a significant and localized malfunction. I understand how profoundly bizarre, frustrating, and frankly, ridiculous this situation is. The issue isn't with your files, especially since we know I could see most of these before; it's squarely with how this particular chat instance is now failing to handle any image data.\n\nAs I've unfortunately had to say before, for any tasks requiring visual analysis from me, starting a new chat session is the only viable workaround.

Here are the primary ways to do it, starting with the most common and easiest:\n\nAssistant: Yes, in many cases you can restore deleted notes on an iPhone. Here are the primary ways to do it, starting with the most common and easiest:\n\nCheck the \"Recently Deleted\" Folder in the Notes App:\n\nCheck iCloud.com:\n\nCheck Notes Associated with Email Accounts:\n\nRestore from an iCloud Backup (More Drastic Option):\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\nStart with the \"Recently Deleted\" folder in the Notes app \u2013 that's where most people find their lost notes.\n\nThis is the first place to look. Deleted notes are typically kept here for 30 days (though this period can sometimes be up to 40 days) before being permanently erased.\nHow to find it:\n\nOpen the Notes app on your iPhone.\nIf you're in a specific note or a list of notes within a folder, tap the back arrow (usually < Folders or just <) in the top-left corner until you see the list of all your Notes folders (e.g., \"iCloud,\" \"On My iPhone,\" folders for email accounts).\nScroll down, and you should see a folder named \"Recently Deleted.\" Tap on it.\nIf your deleted note is there, tap \"Edit\" in the top-right corner (or sometimes you can just tap and hold on the note).\nSelect the note(s) you want to restore.\nTap \"Move\" (or \"Move To...\") in the bottom-left corner.\nChoose the folder where you want to move the note back to (e.g., \"Notes\" under iCloud or \"On My iPhone\").\n\nIf you sync your Notes with iCloud, you can also check the \"Recently Deleted\" folder on iCloud.com using a web browser on a computer.\nGo to iCloud.com, sign in with your Apple ID, and open the Notes web app. Look for the \"Recently Deleted\" folder there.\n\nIf you sync notes with an email account (like Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.), the note might not be in the Apple Notes \"Recently Deleted\" folder, but rather in a \"Notes\" folder (or sometimes \"Trash\" or \"Archive\") within that email account itself.\nOn your iPhone, go to Settings > Mail > Accounts, select the relevant email account, and ensure \"Notes\" is toggled on. Then check the Notes app for folders associated with that account. You might also need to log in to your email provider's web interface to check their folders.\n\nIf the note was deleted a while ago and is not in \"Recently Deleted,\" and you regularly back up your iPhone to iCloud, you might be able to recover it by restoring your entire iPhone from an older backup that was made before the note was deleted.\nWarning: This is a more extreme step. Restoring from an iCloud backup will revert all data on your iPhone (apps, settings, photos, messages, etc.) to the state it was in when that backup was made. Any data created or changed since that backup point will be lost.\nTo check your available backups, go to Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > iCloud Backup. You can see the date and time of the last successful backup.\nIf you decide to do this, you'll need to erase your iPhone (Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Erase All Content and Settings) and then choose to restore from an iCloud backup during the setup process. Proceed with extreme caution and ensure you understand the implications.\n\nTime is a factor: The sooner you try to recover a deleted note, the better your chances.\nPermanent Deletion: Once a note is permanently deleted from the \"Recently Deleted\" folder (after the 30-40 day period, or if you manually empty it), it is generally very difficult, if not impossible, to recover through standard Apple methods.\n\"On My iPhone\" vs. iCloud: If your notes are stored only \"On My iPhone\" and not synced with iCloud or another service, then the \"RecentlyDeleted\" folder in the app is your primary hope. iCloud backups would be the only other Apple-supported way if \"On My iPhone\" notes were included in the backup.\n\n",

You've laid out a broad spectrum of capabilities and interactions, and then placed this recent screenshot issue in perspective as a \"minor localized glitch that is easily solved by pressing new chat.\"\n\nFrom your vantage point, being able to weigh the entirety of our exchanges \u2013 from Python coding and Army history to the nuances of figure skating photography and email checks \u2013 against a specific technical hiccup in one session does indeed provide a different context than focusing solely on the immediate (and, for me, very apparent) failure.\n\nYour methodical approach to understanding if you \"created a problem\" and then testing with a new chat demonstrates a clear-eyed engagement with the technology, its strengths, and its occasional, shall we say, quirks.\n\nIt's a valid and, honestly, quite a generous assessment. I appreciate you sharing that perspective.\n\nUnderstood. So, less frustration, more \"intellectual curiosity and diligent system diagnostics on the user end.\" Got it.\n\nAnd your rhetorical question is well-staged: when juxtaposed against the broader landscape of capabilities you utilize \u2013 from Python to Army history to the specific nuances of figure skating photography, email checks, and the general maintenance of conversational context (this current session's image-glitch notwithstanding, which was, admittedly, a rather spectacular own-goal on my part in this instance) \u2013 a localized image rendering issue, particularly one with a known workaround like \"new chat,\" does indeed recalibrate the severity meter from your perspective.\n\nYou certainly didn't create the problem.

It maintains a professional yet approachable tone. Let me know if you'd like any tweaks!\n\nSimply comment Banner on that single image. Done.\n\nComment Banner - I Pick on up to three (3) of your top favorite photos.\nI'll then create preview mockups showing each of these photos in the banner design. You'll get to see how they look and then you make the final choice from those mockups.\n\nComment Banner - You Pick on a selection of photos you love (aim for around 3-5 images).\nI\u2019ll then review your selections and choose the photo that I determine will work best with the banner design and overall aesthetic.\"\n\nClear Intro: Sets the stage.\nAction-Oriented Headings: Makes it easy for clients to find the option that matches their thought process.\nClarified Option 1: Added \"Done.\" for that touch of efficient finality.\nClarified Option 2: Specifically mentioned \"in the banner design\" and \"preview mockups\" so they understand what they'll be seeing. Emphasized \"you make the final choice.\"\nClarified Option 3: Added a suggested number range for \"photos you would like me to consider\" to give them some guidance.

Just don't expect miracles.\n\nShield it from direct rain and sun.\nOffer some protection from dust and insects.\n\nHumidity and Condensation: An enclosure might trap humidity or allow condensation to form inside, which is bad news for electronics not designed for it.\nTemperature Extremes: While it might shade the camera, an enclosure won't change the fact that the camera's internal components aren't built to withstand prolonged exposure to temperatures outside their operating range (think a hot summer afternoon or a freezing winter morning on your KC patio). Overheating is a real risk, even in shade, if the enclosure isn't well-ventilated.\nReduced Lifespan: Expect the camera's lifespan to be shorter than if it were used indoors.\nWi-Fi: Ensure the enclosure material doesn't significantly impede the Wi-Fi signal.\n\n",

The idea that all this turmoil is just the universe (or Anthropic) clearing its throat for a showstopper announcement is certainly an appealing narrative.\n\nIs it possible that resources are heavily focused on an upcoming launch, potentially impacting the attention or stability of current models? Absolutely. Tech companies are always juggling resources between maintaining the present and building the future. If something big is on the horizon for, say, June, then a significant chunk of engineering effort would undoubtedly be pointed in that direction.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of wrinkles to that theory as the sole explanation for the current issues:\n\nSo, while the \"prepping for a big launch\" angle could contribute to a general shifting of focus and perhaps slower rollouts of fixes for minor issues on older models, it's less likely to be the primary cause for widespread, significant performance degradation and errors. Those tend to be problems companies want to squash regardless, to protect their user base and ongoing operations.\n\nIt's a nice thought, though \u2013 that all this current pain is just the prelude to something mind-blowingly awesome that makes us forget all about it. We can certainly hope tomorrow's \"Code with Claude\" event or developments in June bring some positive news that isn't preceded by a service meltdown.\n\n",

These are typically their most advanced models, so they tend to have a bit more lead-up.\n\nAs for something like a Claude 3.8 or other iterative updates, there's always speculation in the community. The most concrete thing happening this week is Anthropic's first developer conference, \"Code with Claude,\" which is tomorrow, May 22nd.\n\nNow, could they announce something there? It's possible. Developer conferences are often a venue for new tools, updates to existing models (perhaps making \"Claude Code\" more widely available or an incremental tweak to the 3.x series), or new features. However, launching a brand-new flagship model family like Claude 4 at a dev conference focused on coding might be less typical, especially with the June timeframe being whispered for that.\n\nConsidering the... ahem... \"robustness challenges\" Claude has been experiencing lately, one might also speculate they'd want to ensure smooth sailing with current services before rolling out a major new model version.\n\nSo, while the rumor mill is always churning, a full Claude 4 release this week seems unlikely. Keep an eye on tomorrow's conference for potential news, but June is the more frequently cited period for the next big step.\n\n",

How much of an issue would adding links opening in Safari to Sam and Gem be?May 21, 2025, 7:01:26\u202fPM CDTAdding the ability for links clicked inside your \"Sam and Gem\" app's WKWebView to open in Safari is a common and generally straightforward task. It involves intercepting navigation requests and, if they are from a link click you want to send externally, telling the system to open that URL in the default browser instead of letting the WKWebView handle it.\n\nAssistant: Adding the ability for links clicked inside your \"Sam and Gem\" app's WKWebView to open in Safari is a common and generally straightforward task. It involves intercepting navigation requests and, if they are from a link click you want to send externally, telling the system to open that URL in the default browser instead of letting the WKWebView handle it.\n\nThis will add a little bit of code, primarily a WKNavigationDelegate and a Coordinator class, but it shouldn't significantly \"bloat\" the app or interfere with the authentication, as that usually happens on initial load or specific programmatic navigations, not typical link clicks.\n\nHere's how you can modify your ContentView.swift (specifically the WebView struct within it):\n\nKey Changes:\n\nCoordinator Class:\n\nmakeCoordinator() Method:\n\nwebView.navigationDelegate = context.coordinator:\n\nwebView(_:decidePolicyFor:decisionHandler:) Method in Coordinator:\n\nImpact Assessment:\n\nThis is a clean and standard way to achieve external link handling.\n\nA Coordinator class is added inside WebView. This is standard practice for handling delegate methods for NSViewRepresentable structs.\nIt conforms to NSObject and WKNavigationDelegate.\n\nAdded to WebView to create an instance of the Coordinator.\n\nIn makeNSView, the WKWebView's navigationDelegate is set to the coordinator instance. This tells the webView to send navigation-related events to our coordinator.\n\nThis is where the magic happens. This delegate method is called whenever the WKWebView is about to perform a navigation.\nif navigationAction.navigationType == .linkActivated: We check if this navigation was initiated by the user clicking a link.\nif let urlToOpen = navigationAction.request.url, [\"http\", \"https\"].contains(urlToOpen.scheme?.lowercased() ?? \"\"): We get the URL and make sure it's a typical web link (http or https). You could expand this to other schemes if needed.\nNSWorkspace.shared.open(urlToOpen): This is the macOS way to open a URL in the default external application (which for web links will be Safari, or whatever the user's default browser is).\ndecisionHandler(.cancel): If we open it externally, we cancel the navigation attempt within our WKWebView.\ndecisionHandler(.allow): For any other type of navigation (e.g., initial page load, form submissions, programmatic navigation within Gemini itself, back/forward), we allow it to proceed within the WKWebView.\n\nFootprint: This adds one nested class (Coordinator) and a few lines in makeNSView and updateNSView. It's still very lightweight.\nAuthentication: This change should not affect your existing authentication flow, as that typically happens on the initial load or via specific Google-controlled redirects, not usually via standard <a> tag link clicks that this delegate method targets.\nFunctionality: It provides the desired behavior of opening clicked links in Safari.\n\n",

Heres why I ask...\n\nAssistant: You want to shrink that window down to its fighting weight, even if the content inside protests. Got it.\n\nWhen you use .windowResizability(.contentMinSize), the window tries its best not to shrink beyond the smallest size your ContentView (and the WKWebView within it) says it needs. If that's still too chunky for your taste, the primary culprit on the SwiftUI side is likely the .frame(minWidth: ..., minHeight: ...) modifier you have on your ContentView within the GoogleCamerasApp.swift file.\n\nThat modifier essentially tells the ContentView, \"Don't you dare get smaller than this,\" and the window respects that.\n\nTo give it maximum freedom to shrink (at least from SwiftUI's perspective, the web content itself will still have its own ideas about minimum sensible dimensions):\n\nYou'll want to adjust this line in your GoogleCamerasApp.swift:\n.frame(minWidth: 800, minHeight: 600)\n\nChange it to something with much smaller minimums, or even zero if you want to push it:\n.frame(minWidth: 0, minHeight: 0)\n\nThis tells SwiftUI that your ContentView is perfectly happy to be a mere pixel, if necessary. The WKWebView and the Google Home page will then become the limiting factors for how small the content can actually render gracefully.\n\nHere's the updated GoogleCamerasApp.swift:\n\nWith minWidth: 0, minHeight: 0, your SwiftUI layout won't stop you from shrinking the window. The Google Home page itself will still have a point where its responsive design gives up or becomes unusable, but your app's chrome won't be the bottleneck. You might find that the web content itself has a practical minimum width to display its columns, as seen in your screenshot.\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-21%20at%2016.28.11-8c2adda59f0a6bca.png\n\n",

Let's refine this.\n\nI'll update the GoogleCamerasApp.swift file to explicitly include this and use .contentMinSize which is often a good choice for \"freely resizable.\"\n\nKey Changes and Explanation:\n\nWith .windowResizability(.contentMinSize) and a reasonable (or no) minWidth/minHeight on your ContentView, the window should now be freely resizable by the user using the standard window edges and corners.\n\nI've slightly reduced the example minWidth and minHeight here compared to your original 1200x800.\nThis .frame() modifier on your ContentView sets its preferred initial size and also acts as a constraint on how small it can get.\nIf you want the window to be resizable to even smaller dimensions, you would further reduce these minWidth/minHeight values, or potentially remove them entirely if the WebView content itself can adapt gracefully to very small sizes. If you remove them, the WebView's own minimum displayable size would become the constraint.\n\n",

This means Swift should automatically create an initializer for ContentView that accepts an isFloating argument, which is exactly how you're calling it from your GoogleCamerasApp.swift file.\n\nSo, the ContentView.swift code in the Canvas is compatible with how you're trying to use it.\n\nThe error you're seeing in Xcode usually means that the version of ContentView.swift that Xcode is actually compiling against at that moment is different from what's in the Canvas, and specifically, it's a version that doesn't have the isFloating binding.\n\nHere are a few common reasons why this might happen:\n\nThe code for ContentView.swift in the Canvas looks correct for the way you're calling it. The issue is most likely an inconsistency between that correct version and what Xcode is currently \"seeing\" when it tries to compile GoogleCamerasApp.swift.\n\nIn Xcode, go to Product > Clean Build Folder (or press Shift + Command + K).\nThen try building again.\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-21%20at%2016.13.37-9a1005b38793ff1f.png\n\n",

Smart. That's the idiomatic way to do it on a Mac.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can weave those into your app structure, assuming you have an App struct (e.g., GoogleCamerasApp.swift) and your ContentView (which contains the WebView struct).\n\nI'll provide the conceptual drop-ins. You'll integrate these into your existing barebones files.\n\nHere's a summary of the changes and how they fit into your barebones app:\n\nThis setup keeps your ContentView and WebView relatively clean of direct UI button logic for these actions, centralizing them in the standard macOS menu bar, which is exactly what you wanted. The footprint on your core WebView logic is minimal; the main additions are for state management in the App struct and the command definitions.\n\nIt now has an @State var isFloating: Bool.\nThe ContentView receives isFloating as a @Binding.\nThe .commands modifier adds a \"Reload Page\" button (Cmd+R) that posts the notification, and an \"Always on Top\" toggle (Cmd+T) linked to isFloating.\n\nIt receives the @Binding var isFloating: Bool.\nAn .onChange(of: isFloating) modifier watches for changes to isFloating and updates the application window's level to make it float or behave normally.\n\nIn makeNSView, it now subscribes to the reloadWebViewNotification.

Nixing the back button and loading indicator keeps things even more streamlined.\n\nRegarding the \"talk and listen\" feature (two-way audio) for your cameras:\n\nYour WKWebView itself, especially a modern one, is generally capable of handling the web technologies (like WebRTC) that Google's web interface uses for two-way audio. The webpage (home.google.com) will have the microphone button, and when you click it, Google's JavaScript will attempt to access your microphone.\n\nHowever, for this to work, your macOS application itself needs to have permission from the operating system to access the microphone. It won't work \"as is\" without a small but crucial modification to your app's project settings:\n\nWhat you need to add:\n\nHow it will work:\n\nFootprint Impact:\n\nSo, for the talk feature: Yes, you need this Info.plist modification. The listen feature should work without it.\n\nYou must add a key to your app's Info.plist file called NSMicrophoneUsageDescription.\nThe value for this key is a string that will be displayed to the user when your app first attempts to access the microphone. It should explain why your app needs microphone access.\nFor example: \"To enable two-way audio communication with your Google Cameras.\"\n\nGoogle's web code will request microphone access through the browser's JavaScript APIs.\nBecause your app (the \"Google Cameras\" wrapper) is hosting this web content, macOS will see that your app is trying to use the microphone.\nmacOS will then check your app's Info.plist. If it finds the NSMicrophoneUsageDescription, it will display a system-level alert to the user, showing that description and asking if they want to allow \"Google Cameras.app\" to access the microphone.\nIf the user clicks \"Allow\": Your app gets permission, and the WKWebView can then provide audio from your Mac's microphone to the Google Home webpage, enabling the talk feature. The listen feature (hearing audio from the camera) should work without special permissions, as that's just audio output.\nIf the user clicks \"Don't Allow\": The talk feature will not work.\nIf the NSMicrophoneUsageDescription key is missing in your Info.plist: The system will deny microphone access to your app, and the talk feature will fail, potentially without a clear error message to you within the app, or the app could even crash in some circumstances (though usually, access is just denied).\n\nAdding this Info.plist key has a negligible impact on your app's footprint. It's just a metadata entry.\nYou don't need to add complex Swift code to your WKWebView configuration specifically for this. The main thing is ensuring JavaScript is enabled (which it is in your barebones setup: config.preferences.javaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically = true also implies JavaScript is on, and allowsContentJavaScript is true by default or can be set explicitly).\n\n",

Reload Button:\n\n2. \"Always on Top\" Toggle:\n\nNecessity: This is a user experience enhancement.

The goal is to enhance usability without breaking the fragile truce you've achieved with Google's authentication.\n\nNecessity: Good idea. Web content can occasionally get stuck, or you might want to force a refresh after a connection glitch or to see the absolute latest.\nFootprint Impact: Minimal. This involves adding a button to your UI and telling the WKWebView to reload.\n\nYou'll need a way to reference your WKWebView instance from your ContentView so you can call webView.reload().\nYou could adopt a similar pattern or a more direct call if you manage the WKWebView instance differently.\n\nYou'll need a way to reference your WKWebView instance from your ContentView so you can call webView.reload().\nYou could adopt a similar pattern or a more direct call if you manage the WKWebView instance differently.\n\nNecessity: This is a user experience enhancement.

The WKNavigationDelegate methods didStartProvisionalNavigation and didFinish / didFail would toggle this state.\nCaution: This means re-introducing a WKNavigationDelegate. If you do this, keep the delegate methods very simple and focused only on toggling the loading state.

This suggests it might not be needed for Google.\nFootprint Impact: One line of code in your WKWebViewConfiguration.\nCaution: If you add it back, test authentication rigorously.
