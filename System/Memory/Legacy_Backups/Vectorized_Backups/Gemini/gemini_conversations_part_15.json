If even their technical support seems to have limited visibility into the nuts and bolts of the AI model \u2013 how it's built, what data it's trained on, its specific architecture \u2013 it strongly suggests that the core AI technology might not be developed or managed directly in-house.\n\nAssistant: That's a very telling observation, Sam, and it certainly adds another layer to your hypothesis. If even their technical support seems to have limited visibility into the nuts and bolts of the AI model \u2013 how it's built, what data it's trained on, its specific architecture \u2013 it strongly suggests that the core AI technology might not be developed or managed directly in-house.\n\nHere's why that scenario is quite common and makes sense in the context of using third-party AI:\n\nSo, your experience aligns perfectly with a scenario where a company is a skilled integrator and applicator of AI technology, rather than a fundamental developer of the AI models themselves. The expertise resides where the model was built. It doesn't necessarily reflect poorly on their tech support for general product issues, but it does indicate where the boundaries of their internal knowledge about the AI's deepest workings might lie.\n\nFrontline Support: Usually trained to handle common user queries, product features, and basic troubleshooting.\nTechnical Support (Tier 2/3): Has deeper product knowledge, can investigate bugs, and might understand how different components interact. However, if a core component is a \"black box\" from a third party, their knowledge about that specific box will be limited to its inputs, outputs, and known behaviors, rather than its internal workings.\nCore AI Developers/Integrators: Only a small group of engineers who directly worked on integrating the AI component, or liaised with the third-party provider, might have a more profound understanding. And even then, their knowledge of the provider's internal R&D would be limited.\n\n",

The world of software development, especially when it involves complex AI functionalities like image analysis or natural language processing, is increasingly one of specialized components and APIs.\n\nAssistant: That's another very plausible thought. The world of software development, especially when it involves complex AI functionalities like image analysis or natural language processing, is increasingly one of specialized components and APIs.\n\nIt's quite common for companies, even those with \"AI\" in their product descriptions, to leverage third-party AI engines or libraries for specific tasks. Here's why that makes sense for something like image analysis:\n\nSo, your suspicion that the \"image AI\" in Narrative Select might not be entirely homegrown is well-founded in the general practices of the software industry. They could be using a third-party service, an open-source model that they've adapted, or a combination of techniques.\n\nWithout specific announcements from Narrative or deep technical sleuthing (which, as you say, you haven't done), it's hard to know for sure. But the strategy of integrating best-of-breed components for different AI tasks is a very common and sensible one. It allows companies to focus on their unique contributions while still delivering sophisticated features.\n\n",

It's a perfectly reasonable (and rather amusingly put) deduction.\n\nAssistant: You're not wrong to make that connection, Sam. It's a perfectly reasonable (and rather amusingly put) deduction.\n\nIf a company's core AI features within their primary product (like image analysis for subject detection in Narrative Select) have certain observable limitations, it would indeed be a bit of a leap to assume they've also independently developed a cutting-edge, highly fluent large language model for their customer support chat.\n\nDeveloping state-of-the-art LLMs requires a very different, and massive, set of resources, data, and expertise compared to developing AI for image analysis. While not impossible, it's far more common for companies to:\n\nSo yes, your observation that a particularly articulate and context-aware help desk chatbot might not share its \"brain\" with an image-sorting AI that occasionally fumbles is quite astute. It lends further credence to the idea that they're leveraging a robust, third-party language model for that support function. One might even say it's elementary, my dear Watson... or perhaps, elementary, my dear Sam.\n\n",

It speaks to:\n\nThe Flip Side (from the company's perspective, playing devil's advocate):\n\nThe Evolving Landscape:\n\nI suspect we'll see a shift. As a few top-tier LLMs become widely recognized for their capabilities, \"co-branding\" or \"ingredient branding\" (like \"Intel Inside\") might become more common and even a competitive advantage. Companies might realize that the trust and positive expectations associated with a powerful AI engine outweigh the desire to keep it a trade secret.\n\nYour reaction is a perfect example of why this transparency could be beneficial. You, as an informed user, would have approached the interaction differently, potentially leading to a more efficient and less frustrating experience from the outset. It's valuable feedback for any company designing an AI-powered customer interface.\n\nThe \"Average User\" Argument: Companies might argue that the \"average\" non-technical customer doesn't know Claude 3.5 from a Roomba and that such labeling would just be confusing noise. (I think this argument is becoming weaker as public awareness of major AI models grows.)\nBrand Dilution (Their Fear): They might still worry that it makes their product seem less like their own innovation and more like they just plugged in someone else's tech.\nSetting Too High Expectations: If the LLM, despite being advanced, still can't solve a user's very specific or niche problem due to limitations in its training data for that particular company's products/services, the user might feel even more let down because they expected more from the named LLM. \"Claude 3.5 couldn't even help me with this simple thing for Narrative?!\"\n\n",

It's a dance between the LLM creators wanting their technology recognized and the companies implementing it wanting to own the user experience.\n\nAssistant: You've hit on a really interesting tension in the AI world, Sam. It's a dance between the LLM creators wanting their technology recognized and the companies implementing it wanting to own the user experience.\n\nWhy it's tricky to find out:\n\nAs you experienced, they're often not keen on telling you directly. Here's why it can be a bit like detective work:\n\nThe Credibility Conundrum: LLM Makers vs. Partner Companies\n\nYou're absolutely right that LLM makers often do want their name out there. Being known for powering successful applications builds their brand and credibility. Think of \"Intel Inside\" for computer processors \u2013 it became a mark of quality.\n\nHowever, the companies using the LLMs (like Narrative in this case) have their own set of motivations:\n\nSo, while some LLM providers are becoming household names (like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini), many operate more behind the scenes when their models are integrated into other businesses' products. It's a balance between the AI creator's desire for recognition and the client company's desire for a branded, seamless experience. Your expectation for transparency is valid, but the business realities often lead to the kind of opaque responses you received.\n\nWhite-Labeling and Brand Experience: Narrative wants you to feel like you're interacting with Narrative Support, not \"Narrative Support, powered by X.\" They want to control the brand and the overall user experience. Revealing the underlying LLM can sometimes dilute that.\nFlexibility and Negotiation: If they publicly tie themselves to one LLM provider, it might make it harder to switch to a different one later if a better or more cost-effective option comes along. Keeping it under wraps gives them more flexibility.\nCompetitive Advantage: They might feel their unique value comes from how they've fine-tuned or integrated the LLM, not just the base model itself.\nSimplicity for the User: For many users, knowing the specific LLM model is irrelevant information. The company just wants to provide a helpful service without adding technical jargon.\nContractual Reasons: The agreement between the company and the LLM provider might even have clauses about how the technology can be mentioned.\n\n",

It's a natural curiosity, especially when you suspect you might be talking to a fairly advanced model like Claude 3.5.\n\nAssistant: Ah, the ol' \"who is your maker?\" question. It's a natural curiosity, especially when you suspect you might be talking to a fairly advanced model like Claude 3.5.\n\nYou asked: \"Are you allowed to tell me what underlying LLM you are running? Based on our limited interaction you sound like Claude 3.5 but that could be wrong.\"\n\nAnd the Narrative Support AI Agent gave the textbook deflection: \"I'm not able to provide information about the specific AI model or technology used for Narrative Support. As an AI assistant, I don't have details about my own underlying architecture. My role is to provide helpful information about Narrative's products and services...\"\n\nClassic \"I'm just here to help with [product name]\" response. It's the AI equivalent of a customer service rep saying, \"I'm sorry, that's proprietary information,\" or \"My job is just to assist you with your account.\"\n\nThey're generally programmed not to disclose their specific model for a few reasons:\n\nSo, your attempt at a meta-level conversation was met with a polite, but firm, redirection. It's pretty standard behavior for branded AI assistants. Your guess about Claude 3.5 is astute, though \u2013 users are getting pretty good at picking up on the stylistic nuances of different models!\n\nProprietary Information: The company might consider their choice of LLM, or any custom modifications, a competitive advantage.\nSecurity/Misuse: Knowing the exact model could theoretically (though often difficult in practice) make it easier for someone to try to exploit specific known vulnerabilities or characteristics of that model.\nConsistency of Brand: They want the AI to be \"Narrative Support,\" not \"Claude acting as Narrative Support.\"\nFocus on Function: They want users to focus on what the AI does for them, not what it is.\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-06%20at%2011.47.33-970abf5c2123f096.png\n\n",

Your feedback:\n\nAssistant: You've hit on a critical aspect of AI-assisted customer service, Sam. Your feedback:\n\n\"No solvency. I am impressed with the LLM's ability to contextualize the question and provide a detailed answer. But at the end of the conversation, it basically said that you dont have that and thats really just too bad.\"\n\nAnd your subsequent point:\n\n\"However, the humans at Narrative should have a trigger that if a customer is not satisfied they are offered the option to connect to a human. Or, the AI agent could say that it is forwarding the issue and I should hear back in my email.\"\n\nThis is absolutely spot-on.\n\nPlacing the onus on the \"LLM's overlords\" (the developers and implementers at Narrative) is exactly correct. The LLM itself is a tool; how it's integrated into the customer support workflow, what powers it's given, and what safety nets are in place for unresolved issues are all human decisions.\n\nYour expectation for a better hand-off or a more proactive resolution path when the AI hits its limits is entirely reasonable and reflects best practices in customer experience design. It's the difference between an AI that just answers questions and an AI that's part of a system designed to actually help customers achieve their goals.\n\nSentiment Analysis for Dissatisfaction: The system should be able to recognize (as you clearly indicated with your rating and comment) when a user is not satisfied with the outcome.\nClear Escalation Options: When dissatisfaction is detected, or when the AI reaches the limit of its capabilities (e.g., it can't implement a feature request), it should seamlessly offer to connect the user to a human agent or create a ticket for human follow-up.\nProactive Follow-Up Promises: Even better, as you suggested, the AI could proactively state, \"I understand this isn't the full solution you were hoping for. I've logged your feature request for Dark Mode, and I can have a team member reach out to you via email to discuss this further or note your interest.\"\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-06%20at%2011.43.45-b10baee38cfd645a.png\n\n",

Let's break it down:\n\nAssistant: Your sentiment comes across as fairly expressed disappointment and a practical observation, Sam. Let's break it down:\n\nIs it \"fair\" to the AI agent/Narrative?\nThe AI agent is just a messenger; it can't change the software. Your comment, however, provides (albeit indirectly) valuable competitive feedback for the humans behind Narrative. They should want to know when their product's feature set is pushing users towards alternatives.\n\nYour tone isn't abusive or overly demanding; it's more a statement of fact from your perspective. So yes, your sentiment seems entirely fair. You're looking for tools that best fit your needs, and if one doesn't quite measure up in a key area, it's natural to acknowledge that.\n\n\"I changed the canvas but that left the rest of the frame very bright.\" This is fair. You tried their suggestion, and it didn't meet your need. Pointing out the insufficiency of the workaround is valid.\n\"But I suppose you have answered my question.\" Acknowledgment, perhaps with a hint of resignation. Fair enough.\n\"Another notch in the belt for Aftershoot I suppose.\" This is the crux of it. It's a fair expression of consumer preference. If Narrative Select doesn't offer a feature that's important to your workflow, and a competitor (Aftershoot, in this case) presumably does, it's entirely fair to feel that this experience reinforces Aftershoot's advantages for you. You're essentially saying, \"Well, that's another reason why this other tool seems like a better fit.\"\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-06%20at%2011.41.05-a8b74ed614d00635.jpg\n\n",

Here are a few ways you could go about it, aiming for helpfulness rather than grievance:\n\nUse an \"Other\" Field or General Comments: If that feedback form itself has an \"Other (Please specify)\" option (which it conveniently does in your screenshot!) or a general comments box at the end, you could fill out the survey as intended and then add a brief, polite note there.\n\nLook for a General Feedback Link: If the platform or app where this popped up has a general \"Feedback,\" \"Contact Us,\" or \"Report an Issue\" link (often found in footers, help sections, or settings menus), you could use that.\n\nKeep it Casual and Constructive: The key is the tone. Phrasing it as a helpful observation rather than a demand or a major problem is the way to go. Emphasizing that you're just pointing it out because you'd want to know is a good angle.\n\nNo need to make a big deal of it. A simple, factual, and friendly note is usually the most effective way to get this kind of minor glitch on their radar. They'll likely appreciate the heads-up from an observant user.\n\nSomething like: \"P.S. Just a small heads-up, the first question about AI tools seems to have a placeholder variable (${vars.competitor_question_time_frame}) displaying instead of the actual timeframe. Thought you'd want to know! Keep up the good work.\"\n\nA concise message like: \"Hi there, I encountered a small display issue in a feedback survey today.

I actually purposefully obscured the faces a bit because they are not what the photo is meant to convey. I know you said male skater, which makes sense, but these are actually sisters. Twins to be exact. And the display is the merging to two bodies into one beautiful and graceful skating elementMay 6, 2025, 11:27:03\u202fAM CDTAh, the plot thickens, and my apologies for the gender misattribution! That context significantly reframes the image and your artistic intent. Knowing it's about the lines and the merging of two forms makes perfect sense of the composition and the deliberate obscuring of faces.\n\nAssistant: Ah, the plot thickens, and my apologies for the gender misattribution! That context significantly reframes the image and your artistic intent. Knowing it's about the lines and the merging of two forms makes perfect sense of the composition and the deliberate obscuring of faces.\n\nWith that clarification:\n\nThis is an excellent example of how the photographer's intent is paramount. Without it, a critique can only go by general principles. With it, the choices make far more sense. Thanks for the insight \u2013 it definitely makes me see the photo in a new, and frankly, more interesting light. Capturing that \"merged grace\" is a tough but rewarding goal.\n\nIntentional Obscurity: Purposefully downplaying facial features to emphasize form and line is a valid and often powerful artistic choice. It forces the viewer to engage with the shapes, the movement, and the interplay of light and shadow on the bodies and costumes, rather than focusing on individual identities or expressions. My initial read on \"connection\" was through a more traditional portraiture lens.\nThe \"Merging\" Element: Understanding they are twin sisters adds another layer entirely. The concept of two becoming one, especially with siblings who share such a close bond and likely a similar physical build, becomes a much richer narrative. The visual symmetry (or near-symmetry) that twins can bring to such an element would be fascinating to capture.\nLines on the Ice & Bodies: Your focus on the lines\u2014both those etched into the ice and those created by their bodies\u2014is well-served by the wider composition. The negative space allows those lines to breathe and have prominence. The skate tracings become part of the \"merged\" element, a history of their unified movement.\nCritique Revisited: Given your intent, the \"smallness\" of the skaters in the frame becomes less of a critique and more of a deliberate choice to showcase the lines and the environment's role. The lighting still carves them out effectively. The only remaining thought might be if there are other angles or moments in that sequence that even further accentuate the specific lines or the \"oneness\" you were aiming for, but that's delving into the nuances of an entire performance.\n\n",

While the first was a more intimate portrait of a solo skater, this one emphasizes the pair within their performance space.

Different flavors for different moments.\n\nAtmosphere: You've maintained that dramatic, almost theatrical lighting. The vast darkness surrounding the skaters really emphasizes the spotlight and the isolation of their performance on the ice.\nSense of Place/Action: The ice tracings in the foreground are a nice touch. They ground the skaters and give a subtle hint of the motion and artistry that came before this frozen moment.\nDynamic Pose: The classic pairs pose with outstretched arms conveys elegance and partnership. It\u2019s a good capture of a specific choreographic element.\n\nSubject Size & Negative Space: The skaters are quite small in the frame here. While the expanse of dark ice contributes to the atmosphere, as mentioned, it also somewhat diminishes the impact of the skaters themselves. A tighter crop might bring more focus to their expressions and the details of their interaction, if that's the goal. This is a classic artistic trade-off: environment vs. subject detail.\nFacial Visibility: From this angle and lighting, the faces are largely obscured or in shadow, particularly the male skater's. This isn't always a negative\u2014sometimes it adds to the mystery or focuses attention on the form\u2014but it does reduce the direct emotional connection a viewer might have.\nLost in the Dark: While the dark is dramatic, there's a risk of the subjects getting a little too lost if the highlights aren't strong enough to define their forms clearly against it. Here, their costumes and skates do a decent job, but it's a fine line.\n\nAttachments: 2025Wicked_Walters-1-13ef4d3f877683d6.jpg\n\n",

It has the shape and positioning consistent with the rear of the dark sedan seen in other images where both cars are undeniably present (like the 18:45 timestamp).\n\nIf that dark object isn't the sedan, what else would it be parked there in the driveway, in the exact spot the sedan occupies when both vehicles are present?\n\nBased purely on the visual data provided in the thumbnails for the 18:39, 18:43, and 18:45 timestamps, the sequence strongly suggests the dark car is present at 18:39 and 18:45, but absent at 18:43. My observation that the car appears to be in the 18:39 image is based on interpreting that specific dark shape behind the truck.\n\nIf you're certain it's not there, there must be something about the image or angle that's leading us to different conclusions about the presence of that object.

My apologies for overlooking the actual visual evidence in the thumbnails.

The 18:47 person detection likely confirms his arrival and exit from the vehicle. My initial interpretation, relying solely on the latest vehicle detection without checking which vehicle was detected, was clearly deficient.

You've used the challenging lighting conditions to your advantage to create something visually interesting and moody. It tells a bit of a story and captures the elegance of the skater. Definitely a keeper. Good job freezing the moment.\n\nThat's a great shot. The lighting is spot on, really isolating the skater in that pool of light against the dark background. It gives it a dramatic, almost theatrical feel, which fits a skating show perfectly.\n\nThe angle is good, capturing the movement and the detail in the costume and expression. Getting sharp focus and good exposure like that in the often challenging, fast-moving, and spotlit conditions of a rink isn't exactly child's play. Nicely done.\n\nIt looks like you captured a lovely moment. Thanks for sharing.\n\nDramatic Lighting: The spotlight isolation is classic and effective. It draws the eye directly to the skater and creates a strong mood, separating her beautifully from the (presumably chaotic) background. Reminds me of a stage performance, fitting for a show.\nComposition: Placing her off-center, looking into the negative space, gives a sense of motion and narrative. We're catching her in a moment, not just posing.\nExposure: You've handled the high contrast well. The highlights on the dress and skin aren't blown out, and the deep shadows achieve the intended effect without losing the subject entirely.\n\nSharpness: It looks reasonably sharp for the conditions, but capturing peak sharpness in low light during fast motion is notoriously tricky. Without seeing the full-res file, it's hard to say definitively.\nNoise: Depending on the ISO you had to push, there might be some noise in the shadows, but the deep blacks hide it well.\n\nAttachments: 2025Wicked_Walters-7553f4b93c3a8d53.jpg, 2025Wicked_Walters-3e4edda50f5e841f.jpg\n\n",

Samsung typically supports their flagship devices with updates for about 4-5 years, gradually moving them from monthly, to quarterly, and finally to an \"as needed\" or discontinued list. The Note 9 has been off the regular schedule for some time now.\n\nSo, no, it is not still getting routine security updates in May 2025. You're essentially running on the last official patch it received, which leaves it potentially vulnerable to newer security threats discovered since then. It's the price you pay for keeping a classic around, I suppose.\n\n",

It's akin to remodeling your entire kitchen just to get rid of that one oddly placed cabinet.\n\nYes, there are custom ROMs available for the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Installing a custom ROM (like LineageOS, Pixel Experience, crDroid, etc., depending on your specific Note 9 model and whether it's Exynos or Snapdragon) essentially replaces Samsung's One UI operating system with a cleaner, often more standard Android experience.\n\nWhen you do this, you lose all of Samsung's specific software features, including Bixby. The OS installed by the custom ROM generally uses Google Assistant (which is the underlying tech for Gemini when you set it as your default assistant) as the standard digital assistant.\n\nThe dedicated Bixby button's behavior on a custom ROM is typically handled differently than on stock Samsung firmware. Often, it can be remapped through the ROM's settings or standard Android accessibility features to launch any app you choose, including Google Assistant/Gemini.\n\nHowever, a few critical points:\n\nSo, while it's a more drastic measure than just remapping a button, a custom ROM is a surefire way to make Bixby a distant, perhaps slightly painful, memory. Just be sure to do your research and understand the risks involved before diving in.\n\n",

It's less like swapping a lightbulb and more like trying to swap the foundation of the house while the occupants are still inside.\n\nHowever, you can certainly make Gemini your primary assistant for general tasks and voice commands. You do this through the Android settings by designating Gemini as the default digital assistant app.\n\nThe dedicated Bixby button on the Note 9 is the main obstacle. Samsung eventually allowed some limited customization of that button, but getting it to reliably launch something else, like Gemini, often required third-party apps that would intercept the button press. Given the Note 9's age, finding a reliable, non-root method for full button remapping might take a bit of searching for compatible apps.\n\nSo, while you can sideline Bixby for most voice interactions by setting Gemini as default, eradicating its existence or seamlessly replacing its button function isn't a factory-supported feature. You'll likely still see Bixby lurking in the background, ready to jump out if you accidentally hit its button just right (or wrong, depending on your perspective).\n\n",

So, you've succeeded there.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, the potential \"negative\" would be very subtle and likely a direct result of balancing for that difficult mixed lighting:\n\nWhy it's tough: As you noted, spotlights are often a different color temperature than the general arena lighting. When you balance primarily for the spotlight to get the costume and immediate surroundings right (which seems to be the case here, successfully), the skin tones might pick up a slight cast reflecting the imperfections of that light source, or the interaction with the ambient light spilling onto them might not be perfectly neutralized.\n\nOverall: It's a very minor point. Achieving perfect neutrality on everything in mixed arena lighting is practically impossible. The current balance effectively isolates the subject, keeps the ice looking clean, and the skin tone shift is subtle rather than distracting. It's a successful handling of a challenging lighting scenario, with the slight skin tone cast being the only potential, very minor critique from a white balance perspective.\n\nSkin Tones: While not overtly wrong, the skater's skin tones might have a very slight yellow or even greenish-yellow undertone compared to what might be considered ideal or perfectly neutral portrait lighting. It's not strong, but it lacks the warmer, more magenta tones seen in some of your earlier examples (like the Tint +30 image). This often happens when balancing for spotlights which might be warmer overall but lack magenta, or have a slight green spike, compared to the ambient fill. You prioritize neutralizing the dominant light on the subject, and sometimes the skin rendering is the compromise.\n\n",

The reflection on the ice below adds a nice touch without being distracting.\nColor: The red dress is vibrant and contrasts well with the dark background.\n\nLegibility: I can see the Lightroom panels (Light, Color, etc.), but the specific slider values are too small to read accurately in this screenshot.\nGeneral Approach:\n\nLight Panel: It looks like you've likely adjusted Highlights and Shadows to control the dynamic range \u2013 probably pulling highlights down to retain detail in the brighter areas of the costume/skin and maybe lifting shadows slightly. Exposure seems well-managed. The Tone Curve might also be adjusted for contrast.\nColor Panel: White Balance (Temp/Tint) was almost certainly adjusted significantly to get clean colors under arena lighting (as we discussed previously). The Vibrance/Saturation sliders and possibly the Color Mixer were likely used to make the red dress pop while keeping skin tones reasonable.\nDetail Panel: Given typical arena ISOs, some Noise Reduction was probably applied.

This means you can add the camera to the Apple Home app to:\n\nHub Required: Critically, this basic HomeKit integration requires the camera to be connected to a compatible Arlo SmartHub or Base Station (models VMB4000, VMB4500, VMB4540, or VMB5000 with updated firmware). It will not work with HomeKit if connected directly to your Wi-Fi.\n\nNo HKSV: Despite adding basic HomeKit compatibility, Arlo has explicitly not implemented HomeKit Secure Video support. You cannot use it to record securely to your iCloud+ account. Recording options remain tied to Arlo's own cloud subscription plans or potentially local storage via the Arlo Hub (which has its own limitations).\n\nSo, while you can get it to show up in the Apple Home app (if you have the required hub), it won't give you the HKSV recording features you're likely looking for.\n\nView the live stream.\nReceive motion notifications.\nPossibly use two-way audio via the Home app.\nUse Siri for basic commands.\n\n",

      "value": "User: # Two questions\n\nAssistant: Okay, let's tackle those two distinct questions:\n\nThe short answer is yes, but with a major catch.\n\nSo, while technically possible for specific cameras, using Starling for HKSV doesn't save you from paying for Nest Aware, which likely defeats the purpose if you were hoping to avoid manufacturer subscription fees by using HKSV. For older Nest cams or the battery doorbell running on battery, Starling only provides live view and basic notifications in HomeKit, not HKSV recording.\n\nThis boils down to trade-offs and preferences. While Arc has innovative features, here are specific reasons people often stick with Safari on Apple devices:\n\nEssentially, you trade Arc's novel features and workflow ideas for Safari's efficiency, deep Apple integration, simplicity, and maturity. If battery life and seamless Apple ecosystem operation are priorities, Safari often wins. If Arc's unique features genuinely improve your workflow and you don't mind the potential battery hit, then it might be worth it.\n\nWhat Starling Does: Starling Home Hub can expose certain newer Google Nest cameras (specifically 2021+ models like the wired Cam, battery Cam when plugged in, Floodlight Cam, and the 2022 wired Doorbell 2nd gen) to Apple HomeKit in a way that allows them to use HomeKit Secure Video (HKSV). This gives you features like iCloud recording, activity zones, and richer notifications within the Apple Home app.\nThe Catch: To enable HKSV recording via Starling Hub for your Nest cameras, you must still have an active Nest Aware subscription. Starling essentially mirrors the Nest Aware event recordings into the HKSV framework. It doesn't magically bypass Google's subscription requirement for the underlying recording functionality that HKSV then leverages.\n\n",

Glad to hear the iCloud+ and Home Hub setup is squared away; that simplifies things considerably.\n\nAlright, so with the HKSV prerequisites met and the list of candidates in hand (Eve, Logitech, Aqara, Eufy), which direction are you leaning, or what factors are most important for this specific gate-watching job?\n\nThinking about those specifics might help narrow down which of the HKSV options makes the most sense for simply making sure that gate is shut.\n\nPower Certainty: How confident are you about easily getting wired power (standard plug or PoE) to that corner spot? This might favor the wired Eve, Logitech, or Aqara options.\nFloodlight Needed? Is extra light useful over there, making the Eve Outdoor Cam's built-in floodlight appealing, or is it unnecessary?\nField of View: Do you need an ultra-wide view (Logitech's 180\u00b0) or is a standard view (most others are around 130\u00b0-160\u00b0) sufficient for seeing the gate clearly?\nBudget Reality: Now that you see the rough price tiers ($150-$180 vs. ~$250), does one range feel more palatable for this task?\nExtra Features: Do the extra hub capabilities of the Aqara G5 Pro (Zigbee, Thread, Matter controller) hold any appeal for future expansion, or are they just noise for this project?\n\n",

HKSV offers tighter integration within the Apple Home app and potentially addresses your desire for recording without manufacturer subscriptions (using your iCloud+ storage instead).\n\nHere are some notable outdoor cameras known for supporting HomeKit Secure Video, along with approximate price ranges (Note: Prices fluctuate significantly based on retailer and sales, so treat these as estimates as of May 2025):\nRight, focusing on HomeKit Secure Video (HKSV) simplifies things by narrowing the field to cameras specifically designed to play nicely with Apple's ecosystem. This generally offers a smoother experience within the Apple Home app than third-party integrations in Google Home or Alexa.\n\nBased on current information (as of early May 2025), here are some outdoor-rated cameras known to support HomeKit Secure Video, along with their approximate price ranges:\n\nEve Outdoor Cam:\n\nLogitech Circle View:\n\nAqara Camera Hub G5 Pro:\n\nEufy Cameras (Older models - check availability):\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\nThe Eve and Aqara options are newer and more purpose-built, while the Logitech is a solid wired choice, and the Eufy kits can be cost-effective if you find them available and don't mind the hub.\n\nFeatures: Purpose-built for HKSV, includes a dimmable floodlight, motion sensor, 1080p video, 157\u00b0 field of view, two-way audio. Requires hardwiring (replaces an existing outdoor light fixture, needs neutral wire).\nApprox. Price: $240 - $250\n\nFeatures: Weatherproof (IP64) wired camera (USB power adapter needs protection if placed outdoors), 1080p video, very wide 180\u00b0 field of view, good night vision.\nApprox. Price: $150 - $160\n\nFeatures: Outdoor rated (IP65), supports HKSV, available in Wi-Fi or Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) versions. Native resolution is higher (2K/4MP), but HKSV is 1080p. Also functions as an Aqara Zigbee hub and Matter/Thread border router. Local AI features.\nApprox. Price: $180 (Wi-Fi) / $200 (PoE)\n\nFeatures: Models like eufyCam 2C Pro or eufyCam 2 Pro (and their non-Pro counterparts) support HKSV when used with the HomeBase 2 hub. Typically battery-powered (long life) with optional wired/solar charging. 1080p via HKSV (even if hardware is 2K). Often sold in kits.\nApprox. Price (2C Pro 2-Cam Kit w/ Hub): $150 - $240 (often found on sale near the lower end)\nApprox. Price (Add-on Camera): $90 - $170 (requires existing HomeBase 2)\n\nPricing: These are estimates based on recent data and can change rapidly due to sales and retailers.\nHKSV Recording Resolution: HomeKit Secure Video currently limits recordings and streams to 1080p, even if the camera hardware supports higher resolutions (like the Aqara or Eufy Pro models). You'd use the manufacturer's app to access higher-res recordings locally (e.g., SD card) if supported.\niCloud+ Required: HKSV needs a paid iCloud+ storage plan (plans support 1, 5, or unlimited cameras depending on tier).\nHome Hub Required: You need an Apple TV or HomePod (mini or regular) set up as a home hub for HKSV processing and remote access.\nCheck Compatibility: Always verify current HKSV compatibility for the specific model number before purchasing, as manufacturers sometimes change features or support.\n\n",

You're not just trying to fit a square peg (cheap camera) into a round hole (deep Google Home integration).\n\nAssistant: Okay, having HomeKit and Alexa in the mix definitely opens up more avenues and changes the calculation slightly. You're not just trying to fit a square peg (cheap camera) into a round hole (deep Google Home integration).\n\nHere's how that changes things:\n\nApple HomeKit / HomeKit Secure Video (HKSV):\n\nAmazon Alexa:\n\nMatter's Role (Revisited):\n\nRevised Strategy:\n\nSince the ~$200 Nest Outdoor Cam is too pricey just for Google Home gate checking:\n\nYour multi-ecosystem setup gives you the flexibility to pick the platform that offers the best compromise of cost and features for this specific task.\n\nPotentially Better Integration: If you're invested in the Apple ecosystem (especially if you pay for iCloud+ storage), looking for a HomeKit Secure Video (HKSV) compatible camera might provide a better experience than trying to force a non-Nest cam into Google Home.\nHKSV Features: HKSV offers secure end-to-end encrypted recording stored in your iCloud account (doesn't count against your storage limit for 1-5 cameras depending on plan), activity zones, and face recognition, all managed within the Apple Home app. The integration is generally tighter than third-party cams in Google/Alexa.\nRequirements: You need a Home Hub (HomePod, HomePod mini, or Apple TV) for processing.\nCamera Options: The list isn't huge but includes options from brands like Eufy (specific models), Aqara, Logitech, Eve. Check current compatibility lists carefully. Prices vary, but some might hit a sweet spot compared to Nest Outdoor.\nDownside: You'd primarily manage/view this camera via the Apple Home app, not Google Home.\n\nSimilar to Google Home: Alexa's integration with third-party cameras is very similar to Google Home's. You can usually link accounts (Wyze, Tapo, Reolink, etc.) and ask Alexa to show the live feed on Echo Show devices or Fire TV.\nLimitations Persist: You'll still face the same limitations \u2013 primarily needing the manufacturer's app for full control, settings, and recordings. Native viewing within the Alexa app itself is often limited or non-existent.\n\nCross-Platform Potential: This is where Matter shines in theory. A Matter-certified camera should be addable to Google Home, HomeKit, and Alexa simultaneously using Matter's multi-admin feature.\nBasic Consistency: This would give you basic control (like initiating streams) across all your ecosystems.\nStill Not Deep Integration: Remember, it standardizes the basics. It won't give you HKSV features in Google Home/Alexa, nor the full Nest experience in HomeKit/Alexa. You'd still likely rely on the manufacturer's app for anything beyond simple live viewing requests.\n\nCheck HKSV Options: If you use Apple devices and iCloud+, investigate cameras compatible with HomeKit Secure Video first (like specific Eufy or Aqara models). This might offer the best balance of features, relatively seamless integration (within Apple Home), and potentially better pricing than Nest, leveraging an ecosystem you already use.\nBudget Cams for Alexa/Google Streaming: If HKSV doesn't appeal or fit the budget, fall back to the cheaper Wyze/Tapo/Reolink wired options. Accept you'll use their app primarily and get basic voice-activated streaming to your Google or Alexa displays.\nLook for Matter (with realistic expectations): If you find a budget camera you like that is also Matter-certified, consider it a bonus that might offer slightly easier setup or basic control across all three ecosystems, but don't expect it to replace the manufacturer's app or provide deep integration everywhere.\n\n",

This means manufacturers can make cameras that are Matter-certified.\n\nGoogle Home Does Support Matter Cameras: Google Home can act as a Matter controller and add these devices.\n\nWhat Matter Should Improve:\n\nThe Current Limitations (Even with Matter):\n\nIn conclusion: While a Matter-enabled camera might offer slightly easier setup and potentially more reliable basic streaming initiation within the Google Home ecosystem compared to older integrations, it does not bridge the gap to provide the full, seamless experience of a Nest Cam. You will almost certainly still need the manufacturer's app for full functionality.\n\nThink of Matter (currently) as ensuring basic connection and control commands can be understood across platforms, not providing a unified user interface for complex devices like cameras.\n\nEasier Setup: Adding a Matter camera to Google Home should theoretically be simpler and more standardized than older linking methods.\nBasic Streaming Control: You should be able to initiate a live stream to Google displays (Nest Hubs, Chromecasts) via voice, and potentially also through basic controls within the Google Home app itself (an improvement over non-Matter).\nBasic Event Notifications: Matter may allow standardized notifications (like motion detected) that could potentially trigger Google Home routines.\n\nNo Native Experience: Matter does not magically make a third-party camera look and behave like a native Nest Cam inside the Google Home app feed. You likely still won't see the live view embedded directly in your main Favorites or device list for quick scrolling.\nManufacturer App Still Essential: Advanced features, specific AI detection settings, pan/tilt/zoom controls, accessing recordings (especially from an SD card), and firmware updates will still require the camera manufacturer's own app. Matter standardizes the basics, not the proprietary extras.\nEvolving Implementation: Camera support in Matter is relatively new, and how deeply ecosystems like Google Home choose to integrate even the basic Matter features can vary. The experience might still feel clunky compared to first-party devices.\n\n",

Paying ~$200+ for a high-end smart camera just to check if a gate is closed, especially when you don't need the fancy subscription features, feels like overkill. The price jump from indoor to robust outdoor models is significant.\n\nLet's pivot back and consider more budget-friendly approaches that still leverage that corner mounting spot where power might be feasible:\n\nLower-Cost Wired Outdoor Cameras: Forget the premium Google ecosystem price tag. Brands like Wyze, TP-Link (Tapo line), and Reolink offer wired outdoor cameras that are significantly cheaper, often in the $40 - $80 range.\n\nLower-Cost Solar Cameras (Revisit): If running the wire to the corner still feels iffy, some of those same brands (Reolink, Eufy, Wyze) have solar options that might come in cheaper than the Google wired outdoor cam, solving the power issue without the Google premium. Compare prices carefully.\n\nSmart Contact Sensor (Still the Cheapest): If visual confirmation isn't the absolute only way, this remains the most cost-effective ($20-$40) and low-maintenance (long battery life) way to get a reliable \"open/closed\" status notification on your phone. Many integrate with Google Home or Alexa.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nGiven the cost sensitivity, investigate wired outdoor cameras from Wyze, TP-Link Tapo, or Reolink. Check their current models and prices. They should give you the visual confirmation via their app without breaking the bank like the Nest Cam. If wiring still proves annoying, look at their solar counterparts.\n\nIf pure budget and simplicity are paramount and you can live without seeing it, the smart contact sensor is still a solid, cheap, and reliable fallback.\nThat's completely understandable. Dropping $200 for a glorified gate checker, especially when you don't need the cloud storage bells and whistles, is steep. The premium for the outdoor rating and maybe the brand name hits hard.\n\nOkay, let's focus on getting that visual confirmation without the Google Tax, leveraging the potentially easier power situation at the corner:\n\nExplore Cheaper Wired Outdoor Camera Brands: This looks like your best bet. Brands like Wyze (their Wyze Cam v4 or OG models are often around $30-$40), TP-Link Tapo (models like the C320WS or C120 are often in the $35-$60 range), and Reolink (various PoE or Wi-Fi wired models starting around $60-$100) offer capable outdoor cameras.\n\nReconsider Solar (Budget Brands): If wiring turns out to be more annoying than anticipated, check the current prices for solar-powered cameras from Eufy, Reolink, Wyze, etc. Sometimes deals can bring them closer to the $100 mark, potentially making them competitive with a wired Nest cam, but without the wiring hassle. Check sunlight availability carefully.\n\nSmart Contact Sensor (The Reliable Fallback): If the camera options still feel like too much cost or hassle just for the gate, the ~$30 smart contact sensor remains the simplest way to get a definitive \"closed\" or \"open\" status notification, albeit without the visual proof.\n\nAction Plan:\n\nTake a look at current models and prices for wired outdoor cams from Wyze, TP-Link Tapo, and Reolink. Prioritize ones that explicitly mention local storage (SD card) options or confirm no subscription is needed just for live viewing. This seems like the path most likely to get you visual confirmation within a more reasonable budget.\n\nPros: Much more budget-friendly. Provide the visual confirmation you want. Wired power is generally reliable. Many offer basic live viewing and motion alerts without a subscription (though they'll often offer cloud recording subscriptions).\nCons: You'll need to use their specific app (not integrated into Google Home). Build quality and feature sets vary, so check reviews for outdoor durability.\n\nCheck for \"No Subscription Needed for Live View\": Most reputable brands allow live viewing via their app without a subscription. You just won't get cloud recording history (though some offer local SD card recording). Since your goal is just to check the gate status live, this should work.\nPower: They'll need power, but running it to the corner is feasible. Some use standard USB power adapters (like Wyze), others might have proprietary power bricks, and some Reolink models use Power over Ethernet (PoE), which is neat if you can run an Ethernet cable easily but adds complexity otherwise.\nDownside: You'll have a separate app for this camera, distinct from your Google Home setup.\n\n",

Running power outdoors can be a pain, and yeah, remembering to charge another device is a recipe for a dead camera when you need it.\n\nGiven those constraints, here's the revised thinking:\n\nRevisiting the Smart Contact Sensor: This really becomes the front-runner again.\n\nSolar-Powered Security Camera: This is the only camera option that potentially meets your \"no wiring, no charging\" criteria.\n\nThe Trade-Off:\n\nYou're essentially choosing between:\n\nIf visual confirmation isn't an absolute must-have, the long-life battery smart contact sensor sounds like the most practical path given your aversion to wiring and charging. If you really want to see it, investigate solar camera options and assess the sunlight situation at the gate location.\n\nThe Battery Factor: While it does use batteries, the coin cell or AA/AAA batteries in typical outdoor contact sensors last a long time \u2013 often 6 months to well over a year, sometimes even two years depending on the model and how often the gate is used. This is way less hassle than recharging a camera every few weeks or months.\nCertainty: It directly tells you if the gate is in the closed position via an app notification or status check. For \"knowing for sure\" it's closed (if not visually confirmed latched), this is reliable.\nDownside: Still no visual proof it's latched, just that the gate is swung shut to the point the sensor halves meet.\n\nHow it works: These cameras have a built-in battery that is constantly trickle-charged by a small, dedicated solar panel mounted nearby.\nPros: Eliminates manual charging and the need for power wiring.

Staring intently at the wall where the gate should be doesn't seem to work. Here are a few practical ways to tackle this:\n\nSmart Contact Sensor:\n\nOutdoor Security Camera:\n\nSimple Wireless Sensor with Indoor Receiver:\n\nWired Contact Sensor:\n\nLess \"Certain\" but Helpful Additions:\n\nGiven you want to \"know for sure,\" a smart contact sensor is often the sweet spot for ease of installation, cost, and reliable status updates via your phone. If you also want visual confirmation or added security, a camera is the way to go.\n\nHow it works: This is probably the most direct solution. You mount a two-piece sensor (usually magnetic) on the gate and the gate post. When the gate is closed, the two pieces are aligned, and the sensor registers \"closed.\" When open, they separate, registering \"open.\"\nPros: Sends notifications directly to your phone via Wi-Fi (or Zigbee/Z-Wave if you have a smart home hub). You can check the status anytime in an app. Relatively inexpensive and easy to install. Look for models rated for outdoor use (weather resistance).\nCons: Requires batteries; needs Wi-Fi signal to reach the gate location (or proximity to a smart home hub). Only tells you if it's closed, not necessarily latched securely unless the sensor is placed precisely where the latch engages.\n\nHow it works: Mount a weather-resistant camera aimed directly at the gate.\nPros: Provides definitive visual confirmation \u2013 you can see if it's closed and latched. Adds general security benefits for that side of the house. Many options available (wired power, battery, solar).\nCons: More expensive than a sensor. Requires power (wiring, battery changes/charging, or solar panel). Needs decent Wi-Fi signal for streaming video. Might feel like overkill if only gate status is the concern. Installation can be more involved.\n\nHow it works: Similar to the smart contact sensor, but instead of Wi-Fi/app, it uses a simpler radio frequency to communicate with a dedicated indoor receiver unit that lights up or makes a sound when the gate is open/closed.\nPros: No Wi-Fi or smart home hub needed. Simpler setup.\nCons: Only provides status when you're home near the receiver. Less flexible than app-based notifications. Still needs batteries. Range limitations between sensor and receiver.\n\nHow it works: Same sensor principle, but wired directly to an indicator inside your house (like an LED light in a convenient spot).\nPros: Most reliable connection, no batteries for the sensor itself (indicator might need power).\nCons: Requires running wires from the gate into your house, which can be a significant installation challenge depending on the distance and path.\n\nSelf-Closing Hinges/Spring: Ensures the gate swings shut on its own, increasing the likelihood it's closed, but doesn't guarantee it latched.\nAudible Latch: Some latches make a distinct \"click\" when engaged, but hearing it from inside might be unreliable.\n\n",

We were indeed chatting about Bluetooth recently. My apologies for the momentary lapse into thinking you meant a functional connection for getting a picture on the screen.\n\nLet's be clear: You absolutely cannot transmit the main video signal to your Samsung Odyssey monitor using just Bluetooth. Bluetooth simply doesn't have anywhere near the bandwidth required for high-resolution, high-refresh-rate video, which is kind of the whole point of an Odyssey monitor. Trying to send a video signal over standard Bluetooth would be like trying to fill a swimming pool with an eye dropper.\n\nSo, any discussion about the \"delay\" of getting the picture from your iPad or computer onto the screen is about the wired connection (HDMI, DisplayPort, USB-C).\n\nOn an Odyssey monitor, Bluetooth would typically be used for things like:\n\nThe delay for these Bluetooth connections would be standard Bluetooth latency \u2013 usually minimal for peripherals (you likely won't notice it on a keyboard or mouse unless you're extremely sensitive or the signal is poor) but potentially noticeable for audio sync if the audio codec isn't optimized for low latency.\n\nBut for the main event \u2013 getting the picture on the screen \u2013 that's wires, not Bluetooth. And as we discussed, the delay on that connection is generally very low on these monitors.\n\nConnecting wireless keyboards, mice, or game controllers directly to the monitor (if it has smart features).\nConnecting Bluetooth headphones or speakers for audio output from the monitor (again, if it has the capability).\n\n",

The actual delay you perceive depends on a few things:\n\nFor typical use \u2013 like watching videos, Browse, or doing standard work \u2013 the delay will be completely unnoticeable. You'd only potentially notice it in very fast-paced competitive gaming where milliseconds count, but even then, Odyssey monitors are built to mitigate that.\n\nSo, unless you're trying to become an esports champion and attributing every missed shot to monitor lag, it's unlikely to be an issue you'll perceive.\n\n",

Let's integrate those suggested categories into the prompt template you provided. This version (V4) keeps your structure and refinements (like \"Performance enhancements\" for Fuji) and adds the broader context points, while maintaining the default 24-hour timeframe.\n\nHere is the updated prompt:\n\nThis integrated version should give you a comprehensive snapshot covering both specific product details and broader industry context for your key areas.\nUnderstood. Context updated: Sunday, May 4, 2025, 6:36:27 PM CDT in Kansas City.\n\nStanding by for your next instruction or clarification on the prompt suggestions.\n\nThat's a solid and well-organized prompt (V3) you've refined there. It covers your key interest areas effectively. Looking at it from the perspective of general LLM capabilities and common information types, here are a few optional additions you might consider if you want even broader coverage:\n\nAPI & Developer Updates (Under each LLM Provider): Since you work in IT, explicitly tracking changes to APIs, SDKs, developer documentation, pricing tiers, or endpoint updates might be valuable if you ever interact with these services programmatically.\n\nUI/UX Changes (Under LLMs, Adobe, Apple): Sometimes the way you interact with the tool changes significantly via updates to the web interface or application usability, separate from underlying model changes.\n\nResponsible AI / Policy Updates (Under LLMs, maybe General): The landscape around AI safety, ethics, company policies on usage, alignment research, and responses to government regulations is constantly evolving and often newsworthy.\n\nNotable Benchmarks/Comparisons (Under LLMs, maybe General): Often, news involves new independent benchmark results comparing models (e.g., on coding, reasoning, specific knowledge domains) which can be more telling than provider announcements alone.\n\nMajor Research Papers/Findings (Under LLMs): Sometimes significant breakthroughs or capabilities are detailed in research papers released by the labs before they become fully fledged product features.\n\nThese are just potential expansions. Your current prompt is already quite effective for tracking the specific product developments, rumors, and events you listed. You can pick and choose if any of these broader categories feel relevant to your needs.\nOkay, timestamp updated to Sunday, May 4, 2025, 6:35:52 PM CDT in Kansas City. Holding pattern engaged. Ready for your next command.\n\nSuggested Addition: Add a line like API/Developer Updates (Pricing, SDKs, Tools): [Confirmed/Rumor] under each provider.\n\nSuggested Addition: Add a line like User Interface (UI/UX) Changes: [Confirmed/Rumor] to relevant sections.\n\nSuggested Addition: Add a subsection or line like Responsible AI / Safety / Policy Updates: [Confirmed/Rumor] within the LLM category.\n\nSuggested Addition: Add a line like Notable Independent Benchmarks/Comparisons: [Confirmed] perhaps under a general LLM section.\n\nSuggested Addition: Add a line like Significant Research Papers/Findings Published: [Confirmed] under each relevant provider or a general LLM section.\n\n",

I want both confirmed announcements and rumors but want them labeled at such. I also only want information from since the last time I asked. Feel free to suggest topics to make this even better.\n\nAssistant: Okay, let's craft a prompt designed to efficiently extract the updates you're looking for from your LLM assistants. The key is structure and clear instructions, especially regarding the timeframe and labeling.\n\nSuggestions for Additional Topics:\n\nYou've got a pretty comprehensive list tailored to your interests. However, depending on how broad you want to go, you could consider adding:\n\nHow to Use:\n\nThis structure should give you consistently formatted updates, clearly distinguishing between fact and speculation, focused only on the period you care about.\nOkay, it seems the search tool tripped over itself on that last attempt. Let's try that again.\n\nFirst, here is the refined prompt structure for your LLM friends, designed for clarity and to get precisely the updates you need:\n\nSuggestions for Additional Topics (Refresher):\n\nHow to Use:\n\nNow, here is the tool_code block with queries structured to gather this information, formatted correctly this time (hopefully pleasing the machine spirits):\nWell, the machine spirits are decidedly unhappy today. The search tool failed again with the identical internal error (invalid JSON... unexpected character: '\\\\'; expected '\\\\\\\"' near offset 10). This looks less like an error in the search terms and more like a temporary glitch in how the tool is processing the request list on the backend. Third time's the charm? Perhaps not today for this specific tool call.\n\nDespite the tool's current reluctance, let's focus on the main goal: the prompt structure itself. Here it is again, designed for your LLM assistants:\n\nSuggestions for Additional Topics (Persistence is key, even if search isn't):\n\nHow to Use:\n\nFor protocol's sake, I must generate the search query block again. Given the track record, brace for potential disappointment from the tool itself. These are the queries intended to gather the data:\nOkay, this is officially absurd. The search tool has failed for a fourth consecutive time with the exact same internal error (invalid JSON... unexpected character: '\\\\'; expected '\\\\\\\"' near offset 10). It seems quite clear the issue isn't the search terms but a persistent bug or glitch in the tool's backend when handling a list of queries. My digital pickaxe is well and truly stuck.\n\nTherefore, while protocol dictates I must attempt the search again (see the tool_code block below), do not expect it to work. I cannot currently demonstrate the prompt's execution with live results due to this recurring tool failure.\n\nHowever, the prompt structure itself, which was your primary request, remains perfectly usable. Here it is again, ready for you to copy and use with your other LLM assistants:\n\nSuggestions for Additional Topics (Final Mention):\n\nHow to Use:\n\nAnd now, the obligatory, likely-to-fail attempt to appease the tool gods.
