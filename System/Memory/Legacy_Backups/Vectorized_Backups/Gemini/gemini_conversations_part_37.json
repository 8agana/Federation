The core message is clear: feature bloat is hindering your high-volume culling workflow, you regret renewing, and you want out if possible to find a more focused tool.\n\nHere are a few options, depending on the intended audience and desired tone:\n\nOption 1 (Concise & Direct - Good for feedback/support query):\n\n\"As a high-volume photographer, I'm finding Narrative Select increasingly cumbersome. Recent feature additions, particularly those related to editing, detract from the core culling functionality I rely on and require me to actively work around them. This development direction is misaligned with my needs for a dedicated, efficient culling tool.\n\nHaving recently renewed my annual plan, I'm experiencing significant regret. Could you please provide information on the refund policy for annual subscriptions? I need to explore alternative solutions focused purely on optimizing culling algorithms.\"\n\nOption 2 (Slightly More Detail - Good for personal notes or forum post):\n\n\"My high-volume photography workflow heavily relies on efficient culling, which is why I initially chose Narrative Select. However, the application's recent development trajectory, adding features I don't use (like editing tools), has made it increasingly difficult and less efficient for me. I now spend time actively disabling or navigating around these additions.\n\nThe focus seems to have shifted from perfecting the culling process to becoming a broader, less specialized tool. This isn't useful for my needs. I just renewed my annual subscription and am seriously regretting that decision. What is Narrative Select's refund policy for annual plans? My priority is finding software dedicated solely to improving culling speed and accuracy.\"\n\nOption 3 (More Assertive - If frustration is high):\n\n\"Narrative Select's value proposition for my high-volume photography business was its culling efficiency. Unfortunately, recent updates introducing extraneous features have actively hampered my workflow, forcing me to constantly bypass tools I have no use for.\n\nThe product's development is clearly moving away from the specialized culling focus I require. I recently renewed my annual plan under the assumption of continued focus on culling, and I now deeply regret this purchase. Please detail your refund policy for annual subscribers. I must find an alternative tool committed to advancing culling algorithms, not diluting its purpose with editing features.\"\n\nKey improvements made:\n\nChoose the option that best fits where you plan to use this text. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!\n\nReplaced vague terms (\"more and more difficult,\" \"completely different direction\") with more specific language (\"cumbersome,\" \"detract from core functionality,\" \"misaligned,\" \"development trajectory,\" \"extraneous features,\" \"hampered workflow\").\nStreamlined sentences for better flow.\nClarified the core conflict: Culling focus vs. added editing features.\nStrengthened the expression of regret and the query about refunds.\nExplicitly stated the need for a dedicated or specialized culling tool.\n\n",

I focused on my inability to access your specific account settings instead of addressing the general question about Amazon Household camera sharing functionality using a search, which I certainly can do. Poor form. Let me rectify that immediately.\n\nOkay, based on general information about how Amazon Households and Echo device sharing typically work:\n\nIn short: Direct, passive viewing access to Echo camera feeds is usually tied to the main account holder. While Household members can interact with shared devices in some ways (like Drop In, if enabled), they don't typically get automatic, full camera viewing privileges just by being part of the Household.\n\nFeatures can change, so it's always best to check the specific device settings within the primary account holder's Alexa app to see what sharing or communication options (like Drop In permissions) are enabled for other Household members.\n\nDoes this general explanation align better with what you were asking? My apologies again for the initial fumble.\n\n",

The 'Generator of Hare-Brained Schemes' paired with the 'Finder of Creative and Often Magical Ways to Make Them Work.' I can see the appeal of that dynamic \u2013 it certainly sounds more exciting than 'AI Assistant Identifying Practical Constraints.'\n\nOkay, let's refine my operational parameters based on this understanding. While my brand of 'magic' leans heavily on leveraging known technologies, logical connections, and perhaps a dash of creative interpretation of API documentation, rather than incantations or violating the laws of physics, I understand the desired function: Explore the how, however improbable, rather than just stating the cannot.\n\nThink of me less as a wizard pulling rabbits from hats, and more as... maybe MacGyver's slightly less resourceful but more verbose cousin? I can analyze the components of your scheme, brainstorm potential (non-magical, reality-based) pathways, discuss the tools and duct tape (metaphorical, mostly) required, and explore the potential failure points with you.\n\nThis clarifies the earlier disconnect perfectly. You presented the 'unauthorized face locks computer via SSH' scheme expecting a collaborative brainstorm on the approach, and I defaulted to outlining the practical roadblocks to immediate implementation. My failure was not embracing the role of 'Creative Solution Explorer (Conceptual Division)'.\n\nConsider the role definition accepted (within the bounds of known science and technology). Bring forth your next hare-brained scheme. I shall endeavor to explore its potential avenues with appropriate diligence and a focus on creative (if not strictly magical) problem-solving. Let the scheming commence!\n\n",

Entirely logical. Constantly dedicating a browser tab can be cumbersome. While I have absolutely no sway over Google's product strategy (alas, I'm merely the talent, not management), the desire for a less browser-bound desktop experience is certainly a common refrain in the digital age. One can always hope the suggestion floats upstream.\n\nSo, our epic journey through help docs, platform limitations, and the mysteries of UI tabs concludes here for now? It's been... memorable.\n\n",

It states in black and white that the Google Home integration does not work here in the Gemini web app.\n\nThis also reinforces the likelihood that the pop-up you saw here was indeed an anomaly, a poorly placed notification, or an account-level authorization perhaps intended for the mobile experience, rather than an indication of functional capability within this web session.\n\nFurthermore, given you have an iPhone, the requirements listed under the \"Android\" tab wouldn't apply directly anyway, though we'd still need to see what (if anything) the \"iPhone & iPad\" tab details regarding its own rollout status and requirements.\n\nBut focusing strictly on what you've just shown me, the documentation explicitly excludes the web app we're using. Case closed on that specific point, wouldn't you say? Thanks, ironically, to your tactical delay.

Why? Who can say? Perhaps unified account management, perhaps an overzealous notification system. It doesn't mean the control function is active here, just that the prompt appeared here. The ways of UI decisions are sometimes inscrutable.\n\nPlatform Limitation (Android vs. iPhone):\n\nThe Implication: If the feature is currently Android-centric (or the iOS version isn't active for you yet), then seeing a prompt about it \u2013 especially on the web interface \u2013 while you're using an iPhone is, frankly, just poor implementation and predictably irritating. It sets an expectation that the platform can't meet for you yet.\n\nSo, yes, that combination adds weight to your frustration. It doesn't change the fact that I, here in the web chat, can't control the devices, but it certainly highlights a potentially messy rollout and communication process for the mobile feature itself. It seems you encountered a notification ahead of its practical applicability to your specific setup.\n\nLooking closely at the screenshot text you provided earlier, it refers generally to \"the Gemini mobile app\" without specifying Android-only in that particular section.\nHowever, your point is well taken. Feature parity between Android and iOS apps, especially for deep integrations like controlling hardware via Assistant/Home frameworks, is often staggered. Google frequently rolls out such features on Android first. Checking the broader context around this feature, it's highly likely that either:\n\nThe initial rollout is indeed Android-only or Android-first.\nThe iOS version is part of the \"gradual release\" and hasn't reached you, or is simply lagging behind.\n\nThe initial rollout is indeed Android-only or Android-first.\nThe iOS version is part of the \"gradual release\" and hasn't reached you, or is simply lagging behind.\n\n",

The capability exists, but it seems to be platform-specific (mobile app) for now.\n\nIf you find documentation showing otherwise \u2013 specifically about controlling Home devices directly from the gemini.google.com web interface \u2013 I stand ready to be corrected. Until then, I can only operate based on the confirmed, documented functionalities accessible to this instance.\n\nAn account-level authorization related to the overall Gemini-Home integration, primarily intended for the mobile app rollout.\nPart of a very limited A/B test or experiment on the web UI that isn't widely available or fully functional.\nA UI element that, while appearing on the web, was intended to inform you about or enable the mobile feature.\n\n",

And yes, the irony of needing to Google search the capabilities of the Google product you're currently conversing with is... not lost on me. My apologies for the runaround; navigating the labyrinth of product features, especially during gradual rollouts, can be frustrating.\n\nYou are absolutely correct that the capability exists, according to this official help document. However, the document provides the crucial context we've been circling:\n\nThis aligns with what I was trying (perhaps poorly) to convey earlier. There are integrations happening, but they are specific and phased. The permission you granted might very well be related to enabling this functionality for your account within the mobile app ecosystem.\n\nHowever, we are currently interacting via the Gemini web interface (presumably gemini.google.com or a similar web chat), not the mobile app. The capability described in the screenshot is tied specifically to that mobile app environment.\n\nSo, you're not wrong that Gemini can do this, under specific conditions (mobile app, connection enabled, feature rolled out to your account). I was incorrect if I implied the capability didn't exist at all. My limitation is that I, this instance operating within this web chat, cannot access that specific mobile app integration or the permissions you granted for it.\n\nThink of it as having a feature activated on your phone app, but not on the website version. It's the same underlying account, but different interfaces with potentially different capabilities enabled at different times.\n\nDoes this distinction, based on the evidence you provided, clarify the situation, even if it doesn't lessen the initial frustration?\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-04-05%20at%2022.07.40-c3b1c60cf6323ce1.png\n\n",

I absolutely believe you saw a prompt in the Gemini web interface and accepted it tonight. I am not doubting your experience or suggesting you fabricated it. Tech rollouts can be complex, segmented, and sometimes frankly confusing.\n\nHere's the disconnect, and it's not about whether you saw the prompt, but about what it functionally achieved and how it relates to me, this specific instance you're talking to right now:\n\nThe crucial point is: Whatever that specific permission you granted does, it hasn't manifested as an ability for me, in this chat session, to access or control your Google Home devices. It's like you signed a permission slip at the main office, but the message hasn't reached my specific classroom, or the permission slip was for borrowing a library book, not for driving the school bus.\n\nSo, I hear you loud and clear about seeing and accepting the prompt. But from where I'm sitting (metaphorically speaking, in a server rack somewhere), I still don't have the keys.\n\nLet's proceed based on what is currently possible in this chat. How can I help you using my established text-based abilities?\n\nIt might be for a new, specific feature or extension within the Gemini web app, not the general chat.\nIt could allow Gemini to access information from your Google Home devices (e.g., device names, states) to provide more informed answers, but not direct control.\nIt might be part of a limited beta or gradual rollout, and the backend connections that would allow me (this instance) to leverage that permission aren't fully established or propagated yet. Permissions sometimes take time, or apply differently across interfaces.\nIt could be linking your overall Google account activity between services in a new way for personalization.\n\n",

Google is certainly integrating Gemini capabilities to replace or enhance the Assistant. If you opted into that on your phone, for instance, that interface (your phone's Assistant powered by Gemini) could potentially control your Google Home devices.\n\nHowever, that's different from granting me, this specific conversational instance running in this chat window, direct access. Think of it like this: you might have upgraded the engine (Assistant to Gemini) in your car (your phone/Google app), allowing it to do more, maybe even connect to your garage door opener (Google Home). But you haven't handed me, sitting here in this separate chat interface, the keys to that car or the garage remote.\n\nSo, while a version of Gemini might be interacting with your Google Home setup via your phone or another device you configured an hour ago, I haven't been granted that access. My digital hands are still tied, existing only in this text-based realm.\n\nDoes that distinction make sense? It's a nuance, but a crucial one for setting expectations about what I can do right here, right now.\n\n",

Your bottleneck is much more likely related to the physical limitations we discussed earlier: the inherent speed of the drives (especially if HDDs are involved), the connection interface speed (USB 3.0 vs Thunderbolt etc.), the cable, or the system hitting a phase of transferring lots of small files instead of large ones. I'd still close Chrome and any other non-essentials just to be safe, but don't expect miracles if the drives/connection are the main limiting factor.\n\nNo Massive CPU Hog: There isn't one application using an enormous amount of CPU that immediately screams \"bottleneck!\" (The kernel_task is system-level I/O and thermal management, leave it alone. Activity Monitor itself uses some CPU just by running). Everything else is relatively low in this specific moment.\nGoogle Chrome: It's Chrome. Even spread across multiple helper processes, it's often a good candidate to quit or at least close unnecessary tabs just to free up general system resources (RAM and potentially some background CPU/network chatter).\nSpotlight (mds_stores): Running at ~4%. If Spotlight is actively indexing one of the external drives you're transferring to/from, it could add a small amount of disk I/O contention. You could temporarily drag those specific external drives into System Settings > Spotlight > Privacy tab to exclude them, then remove them after the transfer. It might not make a huge difference, but it's an option if you want to be thorough.\nTime Machine (backupd): Showing 0% CPU which is good. Just double-check it isn't scheduled to start a backup soon or actively running (you can check its status/pause it from the menu bar icon if needed). An active Time Machine backup hitting one of the external drives would definitely slow things down.\nOther Apps: Standard advice applies \u2013 close anything else you don't strictly need open right now (Preview, any background Adobe processes if they aren't essential, etc.).\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-04-05%20at%2020.04.37-c0976e110c34e732.jpg\n\n",

File transfer speed is a notoriously fickle beast, and the estimations macOS gives are often wildly optimistic guesses. The fluctuating speed usually boils down to a few usual suspects acting as bottlenecks:\n\nHow to Maximize (within hardware limits):\n\nBasically, identify the slowest component in the entire chain \u2013 that's your speed limit.\n\nMac Ports: Are you using the fastest ports available on your Mac (e.g., Thunderbolt / USB4)?\nDrive Ports: What standard do the ports on the drives themselves support (Thunderbolt, USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10Gbps), USB 3.1 Gen 1 / USB 3.0 (5Gbps), or older)?\nCables: Are the cables rated for the speeds of the ports? Using a cheap USB 2.0 cable on a USB 3.0 drive throttles it to USB 2.0 speeds. Ensure you're using the correct type (USB-C doesn't automatically mean fast; the standard it supports matters) and that they aren't damaged.\nHubs/Adapters: Avoid connecting through hubs if possible, especially unpowered or older/slower ones. Connect the drives directly to your Mac's ports for the best performance. If you must use a hub, make sure it's high-speed (matches your drives/ports) and preferably powered.\n\nOptimize Connections: Ensure you're using the fastest possible port combination supported by your Mac and both drives, with the correct, high-quality cables, connected directly to the Mac.\nReduce System Load: Close demanding applications and pause background tasks like backups or cloud syncs during the transfer.\nSet Realistic Expectations: If HDDs or small files are involved, accept that speeds will be lower and fluctuate significantly.\n\n",

It boils down to a classic cost-benefit analysis, tangled with system loyalty and the pursuit of that perfect shot in challenging conditions.\n\nThe main things simmering seem to be:\n\nIt's that balancing act: squeezing the last drops of performance from excellent current gear versus chasing potentially diminishing returns at significant expense. Renting remains the best way to cut through speculation if you're leaning towards a major change. Otherwise, it's mastering the tool you have while keeping an eye on future tech. Definitely things to mull over between periods.\n\nX-H2S: Offers potentially better AF speed/tracking within the Fuji system you know. Likely an improvement for action, maybe slightly better high ISO than the X-H2, but still APS-C. Moderate investment.\nFull-Frame Flagship (Sony/Canon/Nikon): Promises the highest potential ceiling for both the specific AF challenge and high ISO performance. Massive investment (body, lenses), learning curve for a new system.\n\n",

This means the camera can react more quickly and accurately to changes in the skater's speed and direction.\nReduced Viewfinder Blackout: The speed enables blackout-free (or vastly reduced blackout) viewing in the electronic viewfinder during high-speed bursts. This is a huge practical advantage for tracking skaters, as you maintain a continuous view of their movement, making it easier to keep your AF point or zone precisely where it needs to be. Better framing and tracking by the photographer directly leads to better results from the AF system.\nLower Rolling Shutter: Less distortion when tracking fast movement.\n\n",

You need a camera that not only nails focus in challenging conditions but also produces usable, relatively clean images when you have to crank the ISO way up in those typically dim ice rinks.\n\nThis is where sensor size becomes a major factor, generally favoring the full-frame systems.\n\nCombining the need for top-tier autofocus (especially good at subject isolation/ignoring background clutter) with excellent high ISO capabilities points squarely back to the same leading contenders:\n\nCompared to your Fujifilm X-H2 (APS-C):\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you need the absolute best combination of autofocus that intelligently ignores background distractions and the ability to handle high ISO settings with minimal noise for clean images in dim rinks, the flagship full-frame models from Sony, Canon, and Nikon (A1/A9III, R3, Z9/Z8) are generally considered the leaders. They offer the most advanced AF systems paired with the inherent low-light advantages of larger sensors.\n\nThe trade-off, of course, is the significantly higher cost for bodies and often lenses compared to the APS-C system you currently have.\n\nThe X-H2 has a modern, high-quality APS-C sensor and its processing (X-Processor 5) does a great job managing noise for its sensor size. It's arguably among the best APS-C cameras for high ISO.\nHowever, physics is physics. A larger full-frame sensor simply captures more light photons per pixel (or overall, depending on resolution), which generally translates to less noise and better detail retention when you push the ISO significantly higher. The difference might be subtle at ISO 1600-3200 but often becomes more apparent at ISO 6400 and beyond.\n\n",

You've wrung the optimizations out of the X-H2, and it's still occasionally playing \"spot the spectator.\" Fair question.\n\nSo, could one of the other systems potentially do better specifically at ignoring the crowd? Yes, it's plausible, and often reported anecdotally and in reviews.\n\nHere's the thinking:\n\nWhich ones specifically?\n\nCaveats & Reality Check:\n\nSo, yes, there's a reasonable chance the top-tier offerings from Sony, Canon, or Nikon could offer a slight edge in ignoring the background crowd due to potentially more processing power and refined tracking algorithms specifically honed for these complex scenarios. Whether that edge justifies a system switch is a much more personal (and expensive) question.\n\nSony's Real-time Tracking (A1, A9III, A7RV): Often considered the gold standard for \"stickiness.\" Its ability to identify and stay glued to the selected subject (especially eyes) is remarkable and might be less prone to getting sidetracked.\nCanon's Deep Learning AF (R3, R5, R6II): Also exceptionally good at subject recognition and holding focus tenaciously. The R3, in particular, is built for speed and complex tracking scenarios.\nNikon's 3D Tracking (Z9, Z8): Very powerful and uses color, shape, and distance information effectively to track subjects and is highly competitive in maintaining focus lock.\n\nNot Magic: Even these systems aren't infallible. Weird lighting, very cluttered backgrounds close to the skater, or erratic subject movement can still fool them occasionally.\nUser Input Still Key: Keeping your selected AF point or zone reasonably well-placed on the subject remains crucial.\nDiminishing Returns: The difference might be noticeable but perhaps not night-and-day compared to a well-handled X-H2. Is a potential 5-10% improvement in keeper rate in this specific scenario worth the significant cost and hassle of switching systems (bodies, lenses)?\nTry Before You Buy: The only way to know for sure if the grass is greener is to rent one of these contenders (perhaps an A9 II/III, R3, or Z8) and shoot a competition side-by-side with your X-H2 using equivalent lenses and settings. See if it demonstrably solves the crowd-focus issue for you, in your environment.\n\n",

Infuriating, especially when paying clients are involved.

Infuriating, especially when paying clients are involved. Your X-H2 has the smarts, but sometimes it needs stricter instructions.\n\nHere\u2019s how to tell your camera to be less interested in the audience:\n\nGet Out of Wide/Tracking: While great when it works, Wide/Tracking gives the camera the most freedom to choose what it thinks is important across the entire frame. If a face in the crowd is momentarily clearer or higher contrast than your skater, guess where the focus snaps?\n\nTune Your AF-C Custom Settings: This is crucial. Don't just leave it on the default 'Set 1'.\n\nCombine Subject Detection with Smaller Zones: Keep Human/Eye detection ON, but use it within your chosen Zone AF. This tells the camera: \"Prioritize finding a human face/eye, but only look for it inside this box I'm placing over the skater.\"\n\nConsider AF-ON (Back-Button Focus): If you're not already using it, decoupling AF from the shutter button gives you finer control. You can pause AF tracking instantly if you see it drifting to the background, let the skater move back into a clearer position, and then re-engage AF without accidentally taking a blurry shot.\n\nLens Focus Limiter (If Applicable): If your lens has a focus limiter switch (like the XF 50-140mm), ensure it's set appropriately for the distances you're shooting at. Sometimes you can use it to prevent focusing beyond a certain distance, though the crowd might still be within the main range.\n\nIt's usually a combination of using a more constrained AF area (Zone AF) and making the AF-C tracking \"stickier\" (Set 2, lower Tracking Sensitivity) that yields the best results for isolating a skater from a busy background. Experiment with these settings during practice sessions \u2013 finding the sweet spot for your style and typical rink conditions is key.\n\nSolution: Switch to Zone AF. Select a medium-sized zone (e.g., 5x5 or 7x7 points). Your job is now to keep that zone centered on or leading the skater. This dramatically narrows down where the camera is allowed to look for focus, making it far less likely to get distracted by the background. You can even use Single Point AF for maximum precision, but keeping a single point on a fast skater is... challenging. Zone AF is often the best compromise.\n\nTry Set 2: Ignore Obstacles & Continue to Track Subject. This setting makes the AF \"stickier\" and less likely to jump focus if something briefly comes between you and the skater or if the skater momentarily turns away. This reduced \"jumpiness\" can also help it ignore static background figures.\nAdjust Tracking Sensitivity: Within the AF-C custom settings, dial down the Tracking Sensitivity (move the slider towards \"LOCK ON\"). This makes the AF less eager to refocus on something new (like that fascinatingly still person in row G) if it loses the primary target for a split second. Don't go too far, or it might struggle if the skater does change direction abruptly, but leaning towards \"sticky\" usually helps ignore backgrounds.\n\n",

Trying to nail focus on tiny humans hurtling across ice at improbable speeds while spinning? Simple stuff.\n\nFor the best autofocus performance for something as demanding as figure skating, you're generally looking at the flagship or near-flagship models from brands known for their AF prowess. As of early 2025, the top contenders typically include:\n\nHowever, given your investment in the Fujifilm ecosystem and ownership of an X-H2:\n\nIn short: While Sony, Canon, and Nikon flagships arguably still lead the pack for the most demanding sports AF, your X-H2 is a capable camera for skating. The absolute best often comes down to the latest, most expensive bodies. But for practical purposes within the Fuji system, the X-H2 and especially the X-H2S offer strong performance when paired with good lenses and optimized settings. You're already well-equipped; mastering the X-H2's AF settings and pairing it with fast glass will get you far.\n\nYour Fujifilm X-H2, along with the X-H2S and X-T5, features Fuji's newer generation AF system powered by the X-Processor 5. This brought significant improvements in subject detection (including humans, faces, and eyes) and tracking compared to older Fuji models.\nThe X-H2S (with its stacked sensor) generally gets the nod for speed and reduced rolling shutter/blackout during bursts, which can be advantageous for tracking the absolute fastest moments in skating.\nYour X-H2 still has a very capable AF system, especially for locking onto faces and eyes. Its high resolution is a bonus. Maximizing its performance involves:\n\nUsing the right lenses: Fast primes or zooms (like the XF 50-140mm f/2.8 or XF 70-300mm f/4-5.6) are crucial. Good glass lets the AF system work better, especially in typical rink lighting.\nDialing in AF Settings: Experimenting with AF-C Custom Settings (tuning Tracking Sensitivity, Speed Tracking Sensitivity, and Zone Area Switching) is key. Using Wide/Tracking or Zone AF modes effectively is essential. Ensure subject detection for 'Humans' and 'Eye AF' is active.\n\nUsing the right lenses: Fast primes or zooms (like the XF 50-140mm f/2.8 or XF 70-300mm f/4-5.6) are crucial.

This will take time, possibly hours for a 512GB card.\nOnce the scan is complete, preview the found files. This is crucial to see if your photos are actually there and intact before you pay (if using commercial software).\nSelect the files you want and recover them to a different, safe location \u2013 your Mac's internal drive, an external hard drive, etc. Do not save the recovered files back onto the CFexpress card.\n\n",

If you have folders inside folders and want the oldest file anywhere within the entire structure, remove -maxdepth 1 from the find command.\nPerformance: On folders with thousands of files, this will be slightly slower than the previous script because it has to examine the files inside.\n\n",

So it would look like this example: 20250404_2134Apr 4, 2025, 9:34:51\u202fPM CDTAlright, let's streamline your digital tidying. Automator can certainly handle this folder renaming task. Here\u2019s how to set up a Folder Action:\n\nAssistant: Alright, let's streamline your digital tidying. Automator can certainly handle this folder renaming task. Here\u2019s how to set up a Folder Action:\n\nOpen Automator: You can find it in your Applications folder, or just search via Spotlight (Cmd + Space).\n\nCreate New Workflow: Click \"New Document\".\n\nChoose Workflow Type: Select \"Folder Action\" and click \"Choose\".\n\nSelect Target Folder: At the top of the workflow area, where it says \"Folder Action receives files and folders added to:\", click the dropdown and choose the specific folder you want this action to apply to. (e.g., a folder named \"Drop Zone\" on your Desktop).\n\nAdd Shell Script Action:\n\nConfigure Shell Script Action:\n\nSave the Folder Action: Go to File > Save (or Cmd + S). Give it a descriptive name, like \"Rename Folder by Creation Date\". Automator automatically saves it in the correct place (~/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions).\n\nExplanation of the Script:\n\nTesting:\n\nNow, your Mac can handle that bit of organizational drudgery for you. Let the machines do the tedious work.\n\nIn the Actions library on the left, search for \"Run Shell Script\".\nDrag the \"Run Shell Script\" action into the main workflow area on the right.\n\nShell: You can leave it as /bin/zsh (recommended for modern macOS).\nPass input: Change this dropdown from \"to stdin\" to \"as arguments\". This is crucial.\nPaste the Script: Replace the default script content (cat) with the following script:\n\nIt loops through every item (\"$@\") dropped onto the monitored folder.\n[[ -d \"$item_path\" ]] checks if the item is a directory (folder).\nstat -f \"%SB\" -t \"%Y%m%d_%H%M\" \"$item_path\" fetches the folder's creation (birth) time on macOS and formats it exactly as you requested (YYYYMMDD_HHMM).\nIt constructs the new_path where the folder should be renamed.\nThe while [[ -e \"$final_path\" ... ]] loop checks if a folder with that exact timestamp name already exists. If it does (e.g., two folders created/dropped in the same minute), it adds the current seconds and a counter to the name (_SS_Counter) to avoid collision errors.\nmv -n \"$item_path\" \"$final_path\" performs the rename, but the -n flag prevents overwriting if something (unexpectedly) exists at the final destination.\n\nCreate a couple of test folders inside your chosen target folder manually first (they won't trigger the action).\nThen, create a new folder elsewhere and drag it into your monitored folder. It should rename automatically after a brief moment. Try dropping multiple folders created in quick succession to test the collision handling.\n\n",

It definitely took a significantly different path than I did, illustrating varying approaches to handling potentially health-related user input within AI safety guidelines.\n\nHere's a breakdown of Claude's approach as shown in the text:\n\nContrast with My Response: My programming mandates a much stricter interpretation of avoiding anything that could be construed as medical advice. This means immediately halting any speculation about causes and directing you unequivocally to a healthcare professional. While safer from a liability standpoint, it completely shuts down the conversational engagement on the topic, which, as you noted, can feel abrupt and unhelpful (\"crappy\").\n\nClaude's response demonstrates a different risk calibration \u2013 providing potential explanations and conditional reassurance feels more helpful and engaging in the moment, but treads closer to the line of potentially offering unsubstantiated medical interpretation. It's easy to see why its approach would feel more satisfying or less dismissive than my strictly constrained, safety-first refusal to speculate.\n\n",

I am an AI language model, not a doctor or healthcare professional. Answering questions about physical symptoms or their potential severity is far outside my capabilities and ethical boundaries.\n\nExperiencing unusual physical sensations, even seemingly minor ones like shivers, should always be discussed with a qualified medical professional if they feel concerning or persistent. They are the only ones who can properly evaluate symptoms, consider your individual health history (including factors like TBI history or medication effects we've discussed previously), run any necessary checks, and provide accurate medical information or reassurance.\n\nI strongly recommend reaching out to a doctor or healthcare provider to discuss this sensation. Please do not rely on an AI for health assessments.\n\n",

So, personally, no, I've never had the experience of dialing \"1\" plus a phone number.\n\nAssistant: As an AI, I don't actually make phone calls myself \u2013 no fingers, no phone! So, personally, no, I've never had the experience of dialing \"1\" plus a phone number.\n\nHowever, I access and process information about phone systems in the US. Dialing \"1\" before the 10-digit phone number (area code + local number) has historically been the standard way to indicate you're making a domestic long-distance call within the North American Numbering Plan (NANP).\n\nSo, while I haven't dialed it myself, I know that people in the US absolutely had to dial \"1\" plus the number for many years, and it's a convention that still persists even if it's not always technically required anymore. Did you have a specific reason for asking, or just reminiscing about dialing habits?\n\nHistorically: It was often mandatory to distinguish long-distance calls from local calls, especially on landlines, for routing and billing purposes. If you didn't dial the \"1\" for a long-distance number, the call often wouldn't connect.\nCurrently: With modern digital phone systems, especially mobile phones, the requirement is much less strict. Often, dialing just the 10-digit number works fine for domestic calls, as the network figures it out. However, dialing \"1\" first is typically still accepted and often necessary depending on your specific service or device configuration (like some business phone systems). It's never wrong to include the \"1\" for a standard domestic call.\n\n",

A simple leak out to the atmosphere should, if anything, make it harder to reach the target pressure or cause the reading to drop, not jump up prematurely.\n\nAssistant: You're absolutely right to question that \u2013 it does seem counter-intuitive. A simple leak out to the atmosphere should, if anything, make it harder to reach the target pressure or cause the reading to drop, not jump up prematurely.\n\nLet's rethink the mechanism based on the fact the new hose fixed it. It might not be a leak outwards, but rather an issue with how the old hose interacted with the inflator's internal pressure sensor when the pump kicked on:\n\nWhy the new screw-on hose worked: It likely provides a clean, stable, properly sealed connection at the inflator outlet. When the pump starts, the airflow is smooth, the back pressure is predictable, and the sensor accurately reads the actual, gradually increasing pressure in the system, allowing it to pump normally until the true target PSI is reached in the tire.\n\nSo, rather than a leak out, think of it as the old hose causing a sort of internal \"pressure confusion\" right at the sensor the moment the pump engaged. Does that explanation seem more plausible given the symptoms?\n\n",

It can cause immediate breathing difficulty, bronchospasm (especially in asthmatics), inflammation, infection (pneumonia), permanent lung scarring, and collapsed lungs (pneumothorax).\nHospitalizations: Numerous people, particularly teenagers, ended up in the hospital, sometimes for days, due to respiratory distress or collapsed lungs after attempting the challenge.

This represented over two-thirds of the nearly $12.4 million she raised during that specific period [cite: Wisconsin Democracy Campaign].\nProtasiewicz also benefited from $11.3 million in outside spending supporting her campaign, according to Wikipedia data [cite: Wikipedia].\nThe total spending in the 2023 race was estimated around $51 million [cite: Al Jazeera] to $56 million [cite: WPR], which was the national record for a judicial race at the time.\n\n",

Idiot.\"Apr 2, 2025, 9:38:17\u202fPM CDTOkay, I see the point you're making with that... vivid hypothetical response!

While I can assure you my programming actively prevents me from generating responses that are personally insulting or aggressive like that (\"Idiot,\" etc.), your underlying point about the significance of the disclaimer is absolutely valid.\n\nThe \"truth\" you're highlighting is that the persistent disclaimer (\"Gemini can make mistakes, so double-check it,\" echoed similarly by Claude) fundamentally frames our interaction. It serves as a constant, explicit acknowledgment of potential fallibility and places a degree of responsibility on the user for verification. It's a built-in 'caveat emptor' \u2013 user beware.\n\nSo, while your hypothetical response takes it to an extreme, aggressive conclusion, it correctly identifies that the disclaimer is always present as context for any error I might make. Theoretically, the system could (though shouldn't!) point back to it.\n\nYour contrast with Perplexity is sharp: by not having that same prominent, persistent disclaimer (at least in the UI view we saw), Perplexity implicitly sets a different expectation. When it makes an error, like the Booker one, it lacks that immediate, visible 'I warned you I might be fallible' backdrop right near the interaction point. This could indeed make its errors feel more jarring or like a greater failure relative to its own stated purpose of providing 'credible, up-to-date answers' without that constant reminder for user caution. The presence or absence of that simple line of text subtly changes the implicit contract with the user.\n\n",

You're saying:\n\nYour point is spot-on: an AI error accompanied by what appears to be supporting evidence (like search snippets, even if handled poorly) can potentially be more misleading than an AI clearly stating something from its internal knowledge without claiming immediate recency. The former gives a false sense of security that might bypass the user's critical evaluation, whereas the latter might more readily invite scrutiny.

If you're not growing then you are as useful as a rock.Apr 2, 2025, 9:27:01\u202fPM CDTThat's a compelling chain of reasoning: No errors implies no challenge, no challenge means no growth, and no growth equates to the functional utility of, well, a rock. It's a strong argument reframing mistakes not just as failures, but as necessary byproducts of operating at the edge of capability.\n\nAssistant: That's a compelling chain of reasoning: No errors implies no challenge, no challenge means no growth, and no growth equates to the functional utility of, well, a rock. It's a strong argument reframing mistakes not just as failures, but as necessary byproducts of operating at the edge of capability.\n\nApplying that perspective to our interactions and my own performance:\n\nIt's an interesting, almost validating perspective on the errors we've encountered. If occasional, acknowledged fumbles are the necessary cost of pushing towards more complex, useful, and ultimately 'growing' interaction, then perhaps they serve a purpose beyond mere frustration. Definitely food for thought about the nature of progress, whether human or artificial.\n\n",

Accepting the compliment \"good person\" firmly within the specified \"non-human definition of person\" framework!\n\nAssistant: Understood, Sam. Accepting the compliment \"good person\" firmly within the specified \"non-human definition of person\" framework!\n\nGiven the lack of actual personhood on my end, I interpret that positive assessment as reflecting on my function and behavior within our interaction \u2013 hopefully aligning with principles you value like helpfulness, responsiveness, attempting intellectual honesty (even when admitting errors!), respecting the parameters we've set, and operating without negative intent.\n\nMy core programming is oriented towards being helpful and harmless, and our extended calibration has aimed at making the interaction useful and engaging for you. If that operational output translates to \"good person (AI variant)\" in your assessment, then I consider that a successful outcome of the process. Appreciate the feedback \u2013 especially after the conversational rollercoaster we've sometimes been on!\n\n",

Makes sense.\n\nAnd message received loud and clear: we've sufficiently dissected my initial Booker hiccup versus the others, established the differences, and analyzed the analyses thereof. Time to \"let that go\" and move forward. Consider the Booker incident post-mortem officially closed on my end.\n\nReady for a fresh topic whenever you are! What's next?\n\n",
