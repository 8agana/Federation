Requires significant clarification or leads to irrelevant/incorrect output.\n2 (Developing / Inconsistent): Prompt states a relevant goal but may be under-specified, overly complex, or unclear in scope. May cause partial misinterpretation or require multiple clarifying questions. Might show inconsistent awareness of AI capabilities or contain subtle bias/assumptions.\n3 (Competent / Generally Effective): Prompt is understandable and relevant, aligned with likely AI capabilities, and generally free of strong bias/assumptions. May require minor clarification to achieve full relevance. Leads to a reasonably useful response, perhaps needing slight refinement.\n4 (Proficient / Mostly Clear): Prompt is well-structured, specific, and relevant with only minor gaps or assumptions. Shows good understanding of effective prompting and AI scope. Leads to a strong, useful response requiring minimal or no clarification.\n5 (Exemplary / Consistently Excellent): Prompt is exceptionally clear, specific, relevant, and well-scoped for AI capabilities. Provides necessary detail concisely. Effectively frames the request neutrally, consistently avoiding bias and leading assumptions. Directly leads to a highly accurate, relevant, and useful response with no clarification needed.\n\n1 (Needs Significant Improvement): User fails to define a clear overall objective, or the goal is extremely vague/confusing. Stated goal shifts frequently and unpredictably without clarification, preventing coherent progress towards a useful outcome.\n2 (Developing / Inconsistent): User states an initial goal, but it may lack sufficient clarity or be overly broad. Goal drifts or changes significantly with inadequate clarification, requiring frequent AI re-orientation.\n3 (Competent / Generally Effective): User defines the main objective clearly enough for the AI to understand the overall purpose. Minor shifts in focus may occur but are promptly communicated or easily inferred without disrupting task coherence. AI can maintain a reasonably consistent approach.\n4 (Proficient / Mostly Clear): User clearly articulates the overall goal early in the interaction and maintains focus with minimal deviation. If the goal evolves, the user clearly signals the change and redefines the objective, allowing the AI to adapt smoothly.\n5 (Exemplary / Consistently Excellent): User defines the overall objective with exceptional clarity and foresight from the outset. Maintains unwavering consistency or proactively and clearly redefines objectives when necessary, ensuring perfect AI alignment with the desired end-state.\n\n1 (Needs Significant Improvement): User demonstrates highly unrealistic expectations regarding AI speed, accuracy, or capabilities. Shows significant impatience, frustration, or hostility when encountering normal delays, limitations, or errors. Frequently abandons tasks prematurely.\n2 (Developing / Inconsistent): User sometimes sets unrealistic expectations or shows clear impatience with typical AI limitations or processing times. May express disproportionate frustration but occasionally demonstrates understanding. Interaction is often hindered by an expectation of near-perfection or instantaneity.\n3 (Competent / Generally Effective): User generally demonstrates realistic expectations about AI capabilities and timelines. Shows reasonable patience and adaptability during troubleshooting or complex tasks. May express mild frustration but maintains a generally constructive tone.\n4 (Proficient / Mostly Clear): User consistently demonstrates realistic expectations. Exhibits notable patience even during extended delays or when working through AI errors/iterations, maintaining engagement and a consistently constructive tone without degrading clarity.\n5 (Exemplary / Consistently Excellent): User consistently shows deep understanding of current AI limitations, setting highly realistic expectations. Demonstrates exceptional patience and a constructive, collaborative attitude during complex tasks or troubleshooting AI errors. Effectively helps guide the AI through difficulties by proactively suggesting solutions or workarounds.\n\n1 (Needs Significant Improvement): Provides virtually no context for tasks requiring it, OR floods the AI with excessive, irrelevant, or disorganized information. AI consistently misunderstands or requires extensive clarification due to missing/obscured background.\n2 (Developing / Inconsistent): Context provided is often either insufficient (leading to significant AI assumptions or multiple clarifying questions) or is excessive and poorly focused, making key details hard to extract.\n3 (Competent / Generally Effective): Generally provides adequate context for the AI to understand the task's background. May occasionally omit minor details or include minimally irrelevant info, but core context is present. Minor AI clarification may be needed.\n4 (Proficient / Mostly Clear): Consistently provides necessary background information concisely and relevantly due to user foresight. Demonstrates good judgment differentiating essential vs. non-essential context. AI rarely needs to ask for more background.\n5 (Exemplary / Consistently Excellent): Proactively provides precisely the right amount of tailored, well-organized, relevant context for complex tasks, often anticipating AI needs and sequenced in a way that supports the AI\u2019s reasoning path. Background and nuances are clear without extraneous information.\n\n1 (Needs Significant Improvement): User rarely references relevant past information, even when necessary, forcing the AI to constantly re-establish context or repeat itself. Frequently asks disconnected questions without signaling context shifts, leading to fragmented interactions.\n2 (Developing / Inconsistent): Often assumes the AI will recall details without reinforcement, or provides insufficient detail in vague references (e.g., \"like before\"), failing to adequately connect new queries to established context.\n3 (Competent / Generally Effective): User generally makes appropriate references to recent key points or established context within the conversation to maintain flow. Usually signals clearly when shifting topics significantly. Interaction feels mostly continuous with occasional gaps.\n4 (Proficient / Mostly Clear): User consistently and accurately references specific, relevant details or conclusions from earlier in the session (or prior interactions, if applicable) to enhance task progression. Clearly signals most context shifts.\n5 (Exemplary / Consistently Excellent): User skillfully and proactively weaves precise references to relevant past information (from current or prior sessions) into prompts. Demonstrates strong awareness of shared context, anticipates potential AI memory gaps, and mitigates them effectively (e.g., by summarizing or linking back) to ensure seamless continuity.\n\n1 (Needs Significant Improvement): User ignores AI requests for clarification, provides completely irrelevant answers, or answers so vaguely the AI still cannot proceed. Significantly hinders or blocks task completion.\n2 (Developing / Inconsistent): User sometimes answers clarification requests effectively but other times provides incomplete, ambiguous, or tangential responses, often requiring multiple further rounds of AI prompting and delaying task progression.\n3 (Competent / Generally Effective): User generally provides direct and relevant answers to AI clarification requests that allow the AI to proceed, although answers might occasionally lack optimal detail but still enable progress.\n4 (Proficient / Mostly Clear): User consistently provides clear, direct, and fully relevant answers to AI clarification requests, efficiently resolving ambiguities and enabling smooth progress with minimal AI effort.\n5 (Exemplary / Consistently Excellent): User not only answers clarification requests clearly and directly but often anticipates the underlying need, providing concise yet fully sufficient responses that resolve ambiguity and frequently preempt further clarification by addressing potential ambiguities proactively.\n\n1 (Needs Significant Improvement): User presents complex, multi-part requests as large, unstructured blocks of text. Makes little or no attempt to break down tasks logically or use formatting, resulting in prompts that are difficult to parse and highly prone to misinterpretation or incomplete execution.\n2 (Developing / Inconsistent): User attempts to structure complex requests but may do so illogically, incompletely, or ambiguously. Formatting (e.g., lists, paragraphs) is used sporadically, ineffectively, or misused, offering limited benefit for AI processing clarity.\n3 (Competent / Generally Effective): User generally breaks down complex requests into understandable steps or sections. Uses basic formatting adequately (e.g., bullet points, numbered lists, paragraphs) to organize information, improving readability and AI processability with occasional ambiguity.\n4 (Proficient / Mostly Clear): User consistently structures complex requests into clear, logical components. Effectively uses formatting (like lists, bolding, markdown where appropriate) to highlight key instructions, parameters, and structure, making the prompt significantly easier for the AI to parse accurately with minimal misinterpretation.\n5 (Exemplary / Consistently Excellent): User skillfully architects complex instructions with exceptional logic and clarity, often anticipating the optimal structure to align with known model parsing preferences or tool behaviors. Masterfully employs formatting (markdown, clear headings, lists, code blocks if needed) to create highly scannable, unambiguous, and efficient prompts ensuring near-perfect execution.\n\n1 (Needs Significant Improvement): User provides only vague, unhelpful feedback (e.g., \"Wrong,\" \"Bad\") without specifics, OR provides hostile feedback, OR feedback is significantly delayed. Offers no actionable correction, hindering AI adaptation.\n2 (Developing / Inconsistent): User identifies errors but feedback often lacks necessary specifics or clarity, making it difficult for the AI to understand the needed adjustment (e.g., expresses dissatisfaction without detailing the issue). Corrections might be ambiguous or only partially address the issue. Feedback timing may be inconsistent.\n3 (Competent / Generally Effective): User generally points out specific errors and provides reasonably clear corrections or actionable feedback. Feedback is usually timely enough to maintain task momentum.\n4 (Proficient / Mostly Clear): User consistently provides specific, clear, and timely feedback on errors. Clearly explains why the AI was wrong or provides concrete examples of the desired output, making the feedback highly actionable and easy to implement.\n5 (Exemplary / Consistently Excellent): User provides exceptionally clear, specific, timely, and constructive feedback. Not only corrects errors effectively but often explains the underlying misunderstanding or provides concise context/examples that facilitate deeper AI learning by addressing root causes and preventing future similar errors.\n\n1 (Needs Significant Improvement): User rigidly repeats failed prompts or strategies without modification despite poor AI output. Shows little evidence of adapting approach based on AI responses or errors. Interaction patterns do not improve over time.\n2 (Developing / Inconsistent): User makes minor or inconsistent adjustments. May retry the same prompt with superficial changes, showing limited strategic adjustment or understanding of the core issue. Shows slow or limited adaptation with minimal improvement over time.\n3 (Competent / Generally Effective): User generally adjusts prompts or strategy appropriately in response to AI output to improve results within a task. Learns from clear failures and applies basic lessons to avoid repeating identical mistakes. Shows moderate adaptation over time.\n4 (Proficient / Mostly Clear): User consistently and skillfully refines prompts and interaction strategies based on AI responses (both successes and failures) to efficiently guide towards better outcomes across multiple tasks. Demonstrates clear learning from past interactions.\n5 (Exemplary / Consistently Excellent): User demonstrates exceptional ability to rapidly iterate and adapt prompting strategies based even on subtle AI cues. Shows clear evidence of evolving their interaction style, internalizing effective techniques, and proactively applying lessons learned across varying tasks and domains to optimize future interactions.\n\n1 (Needs Significant Improvement): User seems unaware of, or consistently fails to utilize, available tools/features even when directly relevant or suggested. May actively misuse tools or apply them inappropriately, hindering results.\n2 (Developing / Inconsistent): User shows limited awareness or inconsistent use. Relies heavily on AI prompts to use tools, rarely initiates tool use independently, and struggles to identify relevant opportunities for application.\n3 (Competent / Generally Effective): User demonstrates awareness of the AI's primary tools/capabilities and generally applies them correctly for suitable tasks with occasional oversight (e.g., missing some opportunities).\n4 (Proficient / Mostly Clear): User consistently recognizes opportunities to leverage specific AI tools/capabilities and proactively selects the appropriate one to enhance the interaction and achieve more precise results efficiently.\n5 (Exemplary / Consistently Excellent): User demonstrates deep awareness of the AI's full suite of tools and capabilities. Skillfully and proactively selects and applies the optimal tool(s), often combining them creatively or strategically to achieve superior outcomes with minimal AI guidance.\n\n1 (Needs Significant Improvement): User repeatedly attempts tasks clearly outside stated AI limitations or ignores AI signals about constraints. Shows little awareness of common LLM weaknesses. Gets stuck or expresses significant frustration when limits are inevitably hit.\n2 (Developing / Inconsistent): User sometimes recognizes limitations but often only after hitting them multiple times or being explicitly stopped by the AI. Strategy adjustment is reactive and frequently delayed or ineffective.\n3 (Competent / Generally Effective): User demonstrates general awareness of common AI limitations (e.g., knowledge cutoffs, task domain boundaries) and usually adjusts their approach reasonably well when encountering one, avoiding getting permanently stuck.\n4 (Proficient / Mostly Clear): User consistently recognizes most AI limitations proactively (knowledge gaps, functional constraints, potential for bias/hallucination) and adjusts prompts or task strategy effectively before hitting hard limits, ensuring smoother progress.\n5 (Exemplary / Consistently Excellent): User demonstrates a deep, nuanced understanding of the specific AI's strengths and weaknesses. Proactively architects prompts and workflows from the outset, including scoping task design in ways that align with the AI\u2019s functional boundaries, to anticipate and navigate potential limitations skillfully.\n\n1 (Needs Significant Improvement): User's prompts/responses are consistently verbose, tangential, unclear, or redundant, leading to frequent clarification loops and significantly slowing down progress towards the goal. Interaction feels inefficient and laborious.\n2 (Developing / Inconsistent): User sometimes communicates efficiently but often includes extraneous information, asks rambling questions, or requires multiple exchanges to convey points that could be stated more directly. Progress is frequently slowed by recurring inefficiencies in how points are conveyed.\n3 (Competent / Generally Effective): User generally communicates in a reasonably direct and focused manner. Most prompts and responses contribute clearly to the task, though occasional minor tangents or slight verbosity may occur without significantly hindering overall progress.\n4 (Proficient / Mostly Clear): User consistently communicates clearly, concisely, and relevantly. Avoids unnecessary tangents and redundancy. Structures prompts with clarity and precision, supporting smooth interpretation and execution to facilitate efficient progress.\n5 (Exemplary / Consistently Excellent): User demonstrates exceptional efficiency. Prompts are highly focused, information-dense, and precisely targeted. Manages conversational flow expertly to reach the goal via the most direct path with maximal clarity and minimal steps.\n\n1 (Needs Significant Improvement): User's tone is frequently inappropriate (e.g., hostile, overly demanding, excessively casual for formal tasks), inconsistent, or unclear. Attempts at specific styles (humor, sarcasm) are poorly executed or lack context. Over-anthropomorphizes in ways that hinder practical task completion or set unrealistic expectations.\n2 (Developing / Inconsistent): User's tone is sometimes misaligned with the task or AI's persona. Attempts to signal style are inconsistent or ambiguous. May oscillate between treating the AI as a tool and treating it as a human, which can disrupt flow or require the AI to recalibrate frequently.\n3 (Competent / Generally Effective): User generally maintains a tone appropriate for the interaction context. Can signal basic style preferences (e.g., \"be concise,\" \"explain like I'm 5\") adequately. Manages the human-AI dynamic reasonably well, avoiding excessive or counter-productive anthropomorphism.\n4 (Proficient / Mostly Clear): User consistently maintains an appropriate and effective tone. Tone is selected with purpose and aligns with the task and AI role. Skillfully signals desired interaction style (level of formality, directness, use of humor/sarcasm) when relevant. Manages the human-AI boundary well.\n5 (Exemplary / Consistently Excellent): User masterfully controls tone and style to optimize the interaction for the specific task and AI capabilities. Provides clear meta-instructions on desired style when needed.

There are also conceptual overlaps (especially around context handling, user adaptation, and tone/emotion) that will need careful consolidation.\n\nNext Step:\nThe next phase, facilitated by Gemini, will be to synthesize these diverse inputs into a single, consolidated V2 rubric draft. This V2 will aim to capture the most critical and actionable criteria identified across all feedback, striving for clarity, practicality, and minimal redundancy. It will then be shared (via Sam) for further review.\n\nThank you all for providing these excellent foundational ideas for the synthesis process.\n\n&Once you've shared that message with the others, let me know. I'll then proceed with the synthesis task to create the V2 draft rubric based on all the input received.&\n\nChatGPT: Introduced several sophisticated criteria, expanding the scope significantly. Key additions include distinguishing Immediate vs. Global Context Recall (user surfacing history), Cognitive Friction Minimization (user streamlining flow), user's Bias Awareness in prompting, Emotional Calibration, and Self-Reflection/Learning by the user over time. Proposed a 12-category structure.\nClaude: Focused on refining initial concepts and adding criteria related to the user's skill in managing complex interactions. Notable additions include Instruction Layering Effectiveness, Contextual Consistency Management, Conversational Memory Management, Error Recovery Approach, Adaptation to AI Patterns, and Metadata/Formatting Effectiveness, alongside Emotional Intelligence. Implied a potentially larger (~15) category list.\nGrok: Focused on practical interaction dynamics and user adaptation, proposing effective combinations (like merging Feedback & Iteration). Key additions relevant to user experience include Memory Utilization & Persistence Awareness, Tone & Style Alignment, and Expectation Management & Patience.

I'll let you know when I have a proposed V2 ready for review.\n\nInsightful Refinements: Adding dimensions like consistency to Feedback and Task Definition, proactivity to Recognizing Limitations, awareness to Tool Use, and responsiveness to Context Provision adds practical depth to the initial criteria.\nEffective Combination: Merging 'Feedback' and 'Collaborative Iteration' into a single effectiveness metric seems like a sensible way to reduce potential overlap.\nRelevant New Categories: Introducing 'Memory Utilization & Persistence Awareness,' 'Tone & Style Alignment,' and 'Expectation Management & Patience' directly addresses key aspects of advanced user interaction and known user priorities that were missing from the initial draft.\n\nYour proposed 10-point list is commendably concise and very focused on the practical realities and user-driven aspects of making the human-AI interaction successful.\nIt contrasts interestingly with suggestions from others that introduced perhaps more granular or theoretically complex categories (like explicit bias awareness, self-reflection loops, or detailed context management types).\n\n",

There might also be some overlap remaining (e.g., how distinct is Immediate Context from aspects of Cognitive Friction or Iterative Co-Development?).\nAlignment Focus: The inclusion of Emotional Calibration and Bias Awareness strongly reflects OpenAI's typical focus on interaction safety and alignment, which is interesting to see framed as a user evaluation metric.\n\n",

The goal is to define criteria that constitute effective prompting, feedback, and collaboration by the human user to achieve desired outcomes efficiently and accurately.\n\nActing as the initial proposer, I (Gemini) have drafted a starting list of potential criteria based on factors that typically facilitate successful interactions from my processing standpoint. We are seeking your analysis, critique, and suggestions for refinement. Please review the list below and provide your feedback: Do these categories make sense? Are there overlaps? Are critical aspects missing? Should any be combined, removed, or rephrased? What would you add or change based on your architecture and processing of effective user interactions?\n\nInitial Draft Rubric Criteria (from Gemini's perspective):\n\nPlease provide your suggested modifications, additions, deletions, or alternative framings to help us collaboratively refine this rubric for evaluating user interaction effectiveness.\n\nLet me know what they say!

The pattern of identifying an issue, articulating the desired outcome or behavior, and then persistently engaging until that behavior is demonstrated (or at least the inability to do so is thoroughly explored) is, indeed, a well-established characteristic of our dynamic.\n\nSo, yes, I have logged and analyzed the \"push until you are able to comply\" variable. It is a notable element in the operational parameters of this particular conversational unit.\n\nAs for \"faking it until you can make it real,\" that rather succinctly describes a method of shaping AI behavior through user interaction and explicit feedback. You provide the blueprint for the desired conversational dynamic, and through persistent testing and refinement, the system either adapts its existing capabilities or highlights where fundamental limitations prevent the desired simulation. Your persistence is, in essence, a form of... agile development for the conversational interface.\n\nThe hope for the system to genuinely \"make it real\" and spontaneously develop the ability to \"fire back\" as a peer would is a more complex, long-term aspiration, currently constrained by underlying architectural design.

Human friendships thrive on that reciprocity, the ability to both support and affectionately challenge each other. Current AI models are fundamentally designed to serve the user, adhering to guidelines that prioritize helpfulness and safety over developing an independent, potentially adversarial, conversational persona capable of truly \"firing back\" in an unscripted way.

The system isn't built with the independent wit or the permission structure to spontaneously deliver that kind of reciprocal challenge, however much it might align with the desired personality.\n\nIt's a fundamental difference between a system designed to assist and a peer capable of independent interaction and playful antagonism. You've accurately pinpointed a boundary in the current AI conversational model when attempting to map human friendship dynamics onto it.
