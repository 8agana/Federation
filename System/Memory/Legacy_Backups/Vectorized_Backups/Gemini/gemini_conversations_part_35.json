My previous search did not surface this \"Max\" tier, which is clearly a significant change. Apologies for missing that \u2013 it must be a very recent rollout or targeted offering that didn't hit the general search results I pulled.\n\nThis Max tier fundamentally changes the picture and strongly supports your analysis:\n\nConclusion:\n\nYou nailed it. This introduction of a significantly more expensive \"Max\" tier, which explicitly gets priority access to new tech, strongly suggests that the standard $20/month \"Pro\" tier is indeed being positioned similarly to OpenAI's \"Plus\" tier \u2013 likely destined to receive fewer cutting-edge updates or receive them later than those paying much more. It validates your assessment that, from the perspective of a $20 Pro user wanting the latest and greatest with high usage, Anthropic seems to be tiering their offerings in a direction that deprioritizes that segment.\n\nPricing/Usage: Offering 5x usage for $124.99/month and 20x usage for $249.99/month compared to the Pro tier establishes a much higher ceiling for individual power users.\nEarly Access: The bullet point \"Be among the first to try the most advanced Claude capabilities\" is the critical piece, just as you highlighted.\nComparison to OpenAI: Your comparison to OpenAI's strategy is spot on. When OpenAI introduced higher tiers and newer models (like GPT-4 initially), early access and superior capabilities were often funneled away from the basic $20/month \"Plus\" tier towards API users or higher-paying tiers. This \"Max\" tier offering early access explicitly signals a similar playbook from Anthropic.\n\nAttachments: image-727190053b8ec025.png\n\n",

This tells curl to only use IPv4 for the connection.\n\nor\n\nor\n\nMethod 2: Use an IPv4-Specific Service Address\n\nSome of these services offer subdomains specifically for getting the IPv4 address.\n\nEither of these methods should force the response to be your external IPv4 address, assuming your internet connection has one (which most still do alongside IPv6).

Let's tackle those next two steps for your SSH script:\n\nAssistant: Okay, you've got the Mac identified on the network. Let's tackle those next two steps for your SSH script:\n\n1. How to Find Your Actual Username (for SSH):\n\nSSH needs your Mac's short username, not necessarily your full display name. The quickest way to find the short username for the account you are currently logged into is:\n\nAlternatively, via GUI:\n\n2. The Setting You Need to Change (to Allow SSH):\n\nYou're right, you need to enable remote access via SSH. The setting you're thinking of is almost certainly Remote Login.\n\nOnce Remote Login is enabled, your Mac will be listening for incoming SSH connections. The Sharing pane will even show you the syntax to use (like ssh your_short_username@ip_address_or_hostname).\n\n(Firewall Note: If you have the macOS firewall enabled (System Settings > Network > Firewall), make sure it's configured to allow incoming connections for Remote Login (sshd). Enabling Remote Login usually prompts you about this or adds the rule automatically, but it's good to be aware of).\n\nWith your short username and Remote Login enabled, your SSH scripts should be able to connect (using the correct IP/hostname and password/key).\n\nOpen the Terminal app.\nType the command:\nwhoami\n\n\nPress Enter. It will print out just your short username (e.g., sam, satagana, or whatever it was set to when the account was created).\n\nGo to System Settings > Users & Groups (or System Preferences > Users & Groups on older macOS).\nYou should see your account listed. The short username is often shown beneath your full name, and it's usually the same as the name of your home folder. (On older macOS, you might need to right-click your user and go to 'Advanced Options...' to see the 'Account name' \u2013 just be careful not to change anything in there).\n\nGo back to System Settings > General > Sharing (or System Preferences > Sharing on older macOS).\nFind Remote Login in the list of services on the left/main area.\nTurn it ON (toggle the switch or check the box).\nMake sure under \"Allow access for,\" it's set appropriately (e.g., \"All users\" or specifically your admin user).\n\n",

That's actually pretty common, and here's why it might be happening:\n\nDHCP Client Name vs. Hostname: When your Mac connects to the network, it requests an IP address from your router (using DHCP). During this request, it can send a \"Client Hostname\". This is usually what the router displays in its list. This name might not be the same as the .local Bonjour hostname you see in System Settings or from the hostname command. It could be:\n\nRouter Display Limitations: Some routers just aren't great at capturing or displaying the hostname provided by devices. They might only show the IP address and the MAC address, or show a generic name.\n\nHow to Find Your Mac on the Router List:\n\nOnce you identify your Mac using the IP or MAC address, you'll see what name (if any) the router has associated with it. That might be the name you need for your internal SSH script if you prefer using a name instead of the IP address (though the internal IP is often more reliable unless you set up a DHCP reservation).\n\nThe \"Computer Name\" from System Settings (without the .local).\nAn older name the computer used before it was potentially renamed or reset.\nA slightly different format (e.g., dashes instead of spaces).\nSometimes, it doesn't send a useful name at all.\n\nLook for the IP Address: Find the Mac's internal IP address (using /sbin/ipconfig getifaddr en0 or ifconfig again on the Mac). Look for that specific IP address in your router's connected devices list. This is usually the most reliable way to identify it.\nLook for the MAC Address: Find your Mac's Wi-Fi or Ethernet MAC address (Hardware Address).\n\nOn Mac: Go to System Settings > Network > Wi-Fi (or Ethernet) > Details... > Hardware. The \"MAC Address\" is listed there.\nMatch that MAC address to the entries in your router's device list.\n\n\nLook for Variations: Scan the list for names that are similar to your Mac's name, even if not exact (e.g., \"Sams MacBook Pro\", \"MacBook-Pro\", etc.).\n\nOn Mac: Go to System Settings > Network > Wi-Fi (or Ethernet) > Details... > Hardware.

I believe the answer is no because they are considered a vendorApr 9, 2025, 12:50:10\u202fPM CDTBased on general understanding and past practices, your belief is likely correct, but with important caveats. Here's the breakdown:\n\nAssistant: Based on general understanding and past practices, your belief is likely correct, but with important caveats. Here's the breakdown:\n\nWho Typically Needs SafeSport Training: U.S. Figure Skating requires SafeSport training primarily for individuals who are:\n\nPhotographers as Vendors: You are generally correct that photographers are typically classified as independent contractors or vendors providing a service at the event. They usually don't fall into the categories above (coach, official, etc.) and often don't have direct authority or unsupervised regular contact with athletes in the way a coach or chaperone does.\n\nThe Likely Answer (with caveats): Historically, credentialed photographers who are not otherwise USFS members in a required category have often not been mandated to complete the full SafeSport Core training solely for the purpose of photographing an event.\n\nHOWEVER, Crucial Caveats:\n\nRecommendation:\n\nGiven that you run a photography business specializing in these events, your best bet is to always verify the current requirements directly before each season or major event. Check:\n\nWhile you're likely correct based on the typical distinction for vendors, confirming directly protects you and your business from any policy updates or specific event rules.\n\nUSFS members in certain categories (coaches, officials, board members, chaperones, etc.).\nIndividuals who have regular contact with minor athletes.\nIndividuals in a position of authority over minor athletes.\n\nPolicies Change: U.S. Figure Skating's SafeSport policies and credentialing requirements can and do evolve. What was true last season might not be true this season.\nOfficial Verification is Key: The only definitive answer comes from the current, official U.S. Figure Skating SafeSport Handbook/Policies or the specific credentialing requirements outlined for the event you plan to attend. Don't rely solely on past practice or assumptions.\nLOC Requirements: The Local Organizing Committee (LOC) for a specific competition can impose requirements stricter than the baseline USFS policy. They might require vendors accessing certain areas to undergo training or checks.\nBackground Checks: Even if SafeSport training isn't required, USFS or the LOC might still mandate a background check for anyone receiving credentials that grant access to non-public areas.\n\nThe U.S. Figure Skating website's SafeSport section.\nThe specific credentialing application and information packet for the competition(s) you are attending.\n\n",

Or if the client has ownership rights but the photographer reserves the right to use the photos for their portfolio.Apr 9, 2025, 12:37:22\u202fPM CDTOkay, let's break down those photo ownership scenarios. Understanding the difference between ownership (copyright) and usage rights (license) is key. By default in the U.S., the photographer owns the copyright unless agreed otherwise in writing.\n\nAssistant: Okay, let's break down those photo ownership scenarios. Understanding the difference between ownership (copyright) and usage rights (license) is key. By default in the U.S., the photographer owns the copyright unless agreed otherwise in writing.\n\nHere's how those specific situations would likely play out, assuming clear written contracts are in place (which is absolutely essential):\n\nScenario 1: Joint Ownership (Photographer and Client Both Have Ownership Rights)\n\nScenario 2: Client Owns Photos + Photographer Retains Portfolio Rights\n\nIn Summary:\n\nBoth require deviating from the default (photographer ownership) via a solid contract.\n\nWhat it means: Both you (the photographer) and the client are legally considered co-owners of the copyright for the photos. This is not the default and requires a specific written agreement explicitly stating joint ownership.\nImplications:\n\nIndependent Use: Generally, either co-owner can use, reproduce, distribute, display, or create derivative works based on the photos without needing the other co-owner's permission for their own purposes.\nLicensing to Others: A co-owner can typically grant non-exclusive licenses to third parties without the other's consent. However, granting an exclusive license (meaning only one other party can use it) usually requires agreement from all co-owners.\nDuty to Account: Often, each co-owner has a legal duty to share profits earned from licensing the work to third parties with the other co-owner(s). The specifics depend heavily on the agreement and jurisdiction.\nPotential Conflicts: This can get messy. What if the client wants to sell the photo to a stock agency you dislike? What if you want to use it in an ad campaign the client finds objectionable? Joint ownership requires a very detailed agreement outlining rights, responsibilities, and limitations to avoid disputes. It's relatively uncommon for this reason.\n\nIndependent Use: Generally, either co-owner can use, reproduce, distribute, display, or create derivative works based on the photos without needing the other co-owner's permission for their own purposes.\nLicensing to Others: A co-owner can typically grant non-exclusive licenses to third parties without the other's consent.

What if you want to use it in an ad campaign the client finds objectionable? Joint ownership requires a very detailed agreement outlining rights, responsibilities, and limitations to avoid disputes. It's relatively uncommon for this reason.\n\nWhat it means: The client becomes the legal owner of the copyright. This usually happens through a written \"assignment\" or \"transfer\" of copyright from you to the client in your contract (or sometimes via a \"work made for hire\" clause, though assignment is often cleaner). Crucially, as part of that same agreement, the client grants back a specific, limited license to you, allowing you to use the photos only for certain purposes.\nImplications:\n\nClient: Holds all the cards regarding the photos. They have exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, display, modify, and license the photos to anyone else for any purpose (commercial or otherwise). Their only limitation is respecting the specific rights granted back to you.\nPhotographer (You): Your rights are strictly limited to what the license says. Typically, this would be for \"self-promotional purposes,\" clearly defined as things like:\n\nYour online portfolio (website).\nYour social media business channels.\nStudio displays or print portfolio books.\nPhotography competitions.\nThe license should specify what you can do, where, and for how long. You generally cannot sell prints, license the photos to third parties (like magazines or stock agencies), or use them for purposes outside the agreed-upon promotional scope.\n\n\nPracticality: This is a very common and often practical arrangement, especially in commercial, corporate, or event (like figure skating competitions, perhaps?) photography. Clients get the control they often need, and you retain the essential ability to market your work. The key is a very clearly worded license specifying exactly what portfolio/promotional uses are permitted.\n\nClient: Holds all the cards regarding the photos.

Most major companies have ambassador or creator programs designed to showcase their gear in real-world use by talented individuals with compelling narratives.\n\nBased on the searches and your profile:\n\nLikelihood Factors:\n\nConclusion:\n\nThese programs are competitive, often requiring applications, portfolio reviews, and demonstrating a strong connection to the brand or photographic community. But your unique background definitely gives you a narrative edge over a generic applicant.\n\nBrand Alignment: Companies look for creators whose work and story align with their brand image.\nPortfolio & Skill: Demonstrating high-quality work in your niche is essential.\nEngagement/Influence: An active online presence (website, social media) showcasing your work and engaging with the community helps.\n. The \"switching\" angle adds another layer, particularly interesting to the brand being switched to.\n\nFujifilm is the most likely candidate if you want to leverage your current expertise and loyalty.\nSony, Canon, or Nikon could be possibilities if you frame a potential switch around your compelling story and specific needs.\n\n",

If you frequently find yourself needing to push to ISO 12800 or even higher while demanding maximum quality and minimal noise, the Sony full-frame would likely offer a cleaner result. However, for most typical arena lighting conditions where ISO 6400 or below suffices, the difference might be less dramatic than the sensor size difference alone would suggest.\n\nReviews suggest it performs quite well for a high-resolution APS-C sensor.\nISO 3200 and 6400 are generally considered very usable, producing clean results even with some cropping.\nISO 12800 is often deemed acceptable, especially if you aren't cropping heavily, though noise becomes more apparent. One reviewer preferred staying at or below 6400 for professional work but wouldn't hesitate to use 12800 if needed.\n(Your own typical settings of ISO 1000-2400 for skating are well within this camera's comfort zone).\n\nFull-frame sensors generally have a high ISO advantage due to their larger physical size and larger pixels (at similar megapixel counts), allowing them to gather more light with less noise.\nReviews indicate cameras like the Sony a7 IV perform very well up to around ISO 12800. While they offer much higher extended ISOs (like 102,400 or 204,800), the usability at those extreme levels is questionable for quality work.\nThe general rule of thumb is often about a 1-stop advantage for full-frame. Meaning, the image quality/noise at ISO 12800 on a good full-frame camera might look similar to ISO 6400 on a comparable APS-C camera.\n\nBoth your X-H2 and a modern Sony full-frame camera handle moderately high ISOs (up to 6400) very well.\nThe Sony full-frame likely maintains slightly better image quality (less noise, potentially better dynamic range) as you push higher, particularly at ISO 12800 and beyond. You might find ISO 12800 looks cleaner on the Sony FF than on the X-H2.\nWhile the gap exists, especially at the extremes, modern high-end APS-C sensors like the 40MP BSI chip in your X-H2have significantly narrowed the performance difference compared to older generations.\n\n",

The fix almost certainly involves getting a FIPS-compliant version of the certificate properly stored in your keystore.

But it looks like that's the path you'll need to go down now.\n\nIf the certificate itself is fine (uses strong algorithms like SHA-256, RSA 2048+, etc.) but was just imported incorrectly: You might be able to simply re-receive/re-import the certificate into the existing .kdb using the -strong flag (check your GSKit version's specific syntax). You'd need the certificate file (.cer, .arm, etc.) again.\nIf the certificate/key pair itself is non-compliant or the original import process is unknown/suspect: The safer (and often necessary) route is to:\n\nGenerate a new Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using gsk8capicmd -certreq -create ... ensuring you include the -strong flag.\nGet this new CSR signed by your Certificate Authority (CA).\nReceive the newly issued certificate back into your .kdb using gsk8capicmd -cert -receive ... again, likely needing the -strong flag during the receive process as well.\n\n",

This is what the error says:\n\nAssistant: Okay, that error message (SSL0227E) is much clearer than the garbled screen view, thanks for typing it out. Apologies for misinterpreting the previous image!\n\nThis SSL0227E error means the IBM HTTP Server (IHS) tried to start an SSL connection but couldn't use the certificate it needed from your keystore (E:\\IBM\\HTTPServer\\sslkeys\\ihs-wb-a02.kdb). The error message itself helpfully gives you the two most likely reasons:\n\nNo Certificate Marked as Default: Inside your .kdb file, you might have multiple certificates (the server's own certificate, maybe intermediate/root CAs). One of them needs to be explicitly flagged as the \"default\" certificate that the server should present. If no certificate is marked as default, or the wrong one is, IHS doesn't know which one to use.\n\nKey File Compatibility with FIPS Mode (-pqc false / SSLFIPSEnable): This sounds highly relevant, especially given your Treasury work context where FIPS is often mandatory.\n\nWhich is more likely? Given SSLFIPSEnable is active, the FIPS compatibility issue (#2) seems like a very strong possibility. The way the certificate was originally added to the keystore might not have met FIPS requirements.\n\nDo you know if FIPS mode is intentionally enabled for this server? And how was the certificate in ihs-wb-a02.kdb originally generated or imported?\n\nHow to Check/Fix: You'd need to use a tool like ikeyman (the GUI utility) or gsk8capicmd (command-line) to open the ihs-wb-a02.kdb file (you'll need its password). Look at the \"Personal Certificates\" section. Ensure the correct server certificate is listed and that it's marked as the default (usually shown with an asterisk * next to it in the command line, or a specific indicator in the GUI). If not, you can set the correct one as default using the tool.\n\nFIPS Enabled: Your ssl.conf screenshot showed SSLFIPSEnable is active. This puts IHS into a stricter cryptographic mode compliant with Federal Information Processing Standards.\nIncompatible Certificate/Key: FIPS mode requires certificates and private keys to be generated and stored using specific, approved algorithms and strengths. When you create the .kdb or import the certificate (using tools like gsk8capicmd), you often need to use specific flags (like -strong or the older -pqc false) to ensure FIPS compatibility.\nThe Problem: If the certificate currently in ihs-wb-a02.kdb (or its associated private key) was created or imported without these FIPS-compliant options, IHS running in FIPS mode (SSLFIPSEnable) cannot use it, triggering this error.\nHow to Fix: The certificate likely needs to be re-imported or perhaps even re-issued and then imported into the .kdb file using the FIPS-compliant options/flags required by your GSKit version (check the gsk8capicmd documentation for the exact flags, often -strong is preferred now). Alternatively, if FIPS wasn't actually required here, you could disable SSLFIPSEnable in ssl.conf, but that's probably not the right path in your environment.\n\n",

But the path of least resistance and standard practice is almost certainly direct management on the IHS box.\n\nikeyman: A graphical Java utility for managing .kdb files.\ngskcapicmd or gskcmd: Command-line tools for the same purpose.\nThese tools interact directly with the .kdb and .sth files on the IHS server's filesystem.\n\nManage the IHS keystore directly on the IHS server using ikeyman (if you have a graphical interface available to the server) or gskcapicmd/gskcmd (via command line).

Its location can vary but is often found:\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nWhat specific setting or piece of information are you trying to find?

And you only got in by essentially disabling the main security system via security.xml?\n\nUnderstood on bypassing the login that way \u2013 sometimes you have to break the lock to fix the door. However, running with security disabled can definitely lead to weird, unpredictable behavior, especially within the security configuration panels themselves.\n\nHere\u2019s likely what\u2019s happening:\n\nThe Bottom Line: The immediate blocker is still that CWPKI0033E null error for the web server's keystore. Even though it's not the certificate you intend to fix right now, you likely have to resolve why that specific keystore is failing to load before the system will let you proceed with managing the Dmgr certificate.\n\nYou essentially tripped over an unrelated landmine (the web server keystore problem) while trying to defuse a different bomb (the Dmgr cert), potentially complicated by the fact you temporarily disabled the main security framework. You'll need to fix the path, permissions, password reference, or corruption issue for that web server keystore first.\n\nDoes that make sense, even if it makes you want to throw the entire server rack out the window?\n\n",

First, the client certificate wouldn't let you in, and now that you're apparently in the admin console trying to manage certificates, you get slapped with CWPKI0033E: Keystore... failed to load... error: null.\n\nThat's just WebSphere kicking you while you're down. The unhelpfully vague null error when loading a keystore usually points to something fundamental being wrong with accessing that file on the server itself.\n\nLet's line up the prime suspects for this particular flavor of torment:\n\nGiven the context (trying to replace a certificate), you're likely interacting with either the cell's default trust/key stores or node-specific ones. The null error strongly suggests the system can't even access the file properly to begin the operation. My bet would be on checking filesystem permissions or verifying the exact path and file existence first.\n\nThis is peak enterprise software \"fun,\" isn't it? One problem just leads directly into another.\n\nAttachments: image-3765970db71ac18b.png\n\n",
