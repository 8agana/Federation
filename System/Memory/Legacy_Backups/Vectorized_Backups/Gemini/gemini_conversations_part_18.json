When you deploy a new version of the Google Apps Script to that same deployment ID, the URL doesn't change. The forms will automatically talk to the latest live version of the script code you deployed. You only need to redeploy to Netlify if you change the HTML or JavaScript within the form files themselves.\n\nOkay, the screenshot confirms that unfortunately, adding the doGet function didn't solve the underlying submission error either. Both forms are still failing to get a success response from the Apps Script backend.\n\nSince we can't seem to view the detailed error logs, we need to definitively isolate where the script is failing using the simplification method.\n\nLet's try Debugging Test 1 again (Minimal Script):\n\nGo back to the Apps Script Editor.\n\nDELETE all the code currently in the editor (both doPost and doGet).\n\nCopy and Paste this ultra-minimal code:\n\n(Note: This version has no doGet, no LockService, no Sheet interaction, no Email - absolutely bare minimum)\n\nSave the script (floppy disk icon).\n\nDeploy a New Version:\n\nTest a Form: Go to either the Competition or Contact form on its Netlify URL. Fill minimally and click Submit.\n\nCrucial Question: What happens when you submit the form now with this bare-minimum script deployed?\n\nThis test is critical. If you still get the error (A), the problem is fundamental (likely deployment permissions/settings). If it succeeds now (B), the problem is definitely in the Sheet/Email code we commented out.\n\nClick Deploy > Manage deployments.\nClick the pencil icon (Edit).\nChange Version to \"New version\".

That screenshot (Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 20.02.14.png) showing Script function not found: doGet is actually a very important clue.\n\nHere's what it means:\n\nWhy this might be causing the form submission errors:\n\nEven though your forms are correctly using POST (which should trigger doPost), sometimes the Apps Script web app environment requires both functions to be present for the deployment to work reliably or to handle all request types gracefully. The absence of doGet might be causing the POST requests to fail unexpectedly behind the scenes.\n\nLet's Fix It:\n\nThis is usually easy to resolve by adding a simple doGet(e) function.\n\nGo back to the Apps Script Editor.\n\nScroll to the very bottom of your existing code (after the closing } brace of the doPost function).\n\nCopy and paste this new function definition below your existing code:\n\n(This function just provides a basic message if someone tries to visit the script URL directly).\n\nSave the script (floppy disk icon).\n\nCRITICAL: Deploy a New Version:\n\nTest Again: Once the new version (containing both doPost and doGet) is deployed, go back to one of your forms on Netlify and try submitting it again.\n\nAdding the doGet function often clears up these kinds of unexplained web app failures.

You're looking at the \"Execution log\" area at the bottom of the script editor window (Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 19.59.12.jpg).\n\nAssistant: Ah, I see the confusion now! You're looking at the \"Execution log\" area at the bottom of the script editor window (Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 19.59.12.jpg).\n\nThat specific log area typically shows output only when you manually run or debug a function using the \"Run\" or \"Debug\" buttons at the top of the editor. Since our doPost(e) function is designed to be triggered automatically by your web form submitting data (via the Workspace call), its logs won't show up in that bottom panel. Clicking it likely prompts you to \"Run\" the function manually, which would fail anyway because it wouldn't have the necessary form data (e).\n\nWhere the logs should be:\n\nThe Logger.log output from when your form triggered the script should be associated with the entries in the \"Executions\" list (the one accessed via the speedometer icon  speedometer on the left sidebar).\n\nLet's try accessing those Executions list details one more time:\n\nEven though it was unhelpful before, look very carefully now. Does that \"Process details\" screen show any text output at all that might contain our log messages? Look for things like:\n\nIf there's absolutely nothing there related to the logs after trying \"Process details\" again, then the logging isn't being displayed for us easily, and we'll have to go back to debugging by simplifying the script code itself.

They mostly reflect the symptom (the connection failing or being closed) rather than the root cause within the script.\n\nWe still need to figure out what's happening inside the Apps Script. Did you get a chance to check the Executions list again after deploying the script version with the Logger.log statements and trying another submission? Seeing which log messages appear (or don't appear) is still our best bet without direct error visibility.\n\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 499 (...): This often indicates the client (your browser) closed the connection before the server (the Apps Script) finished processing. This could happen if the script is taking too long or erroring out, but the 499 itself isn't the cause of the script error.\nFailed: API server check: This seems related to some internal browser check or perhaps an extension, not directly tied to your form submission's Workspace call failing.\nError: TypeError: Load failed: This is a generic JavaScript error often related to network issues or script loading problems, but without more context from the Apps Script logs themselves, it's hard to pinpoint if it's directly related to the Workspace failing or something else on the page.\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-02%20at%2019.53.00-4b67a11a10cad8a5.png\n\n",

That rules out one very common cause of failure! The headers you pasted also look correctly spread across Row 1.\n\nRegarding your pondering: \"There is an error on both action calls. Sending the email AND writing to the spreasheet, right?\"\n\nYou're thinking along the right lines. Here's how the script flows:\n\nIf any error happens during steps 2, 3, 4, or 5, the script immediately jumps to the catch (error) {...} block, logs the error (which we unfortunately can't seem to view easily), and sends back the \"error\" response to the form (triggering your alert box).\n\nSo, yes, if the error happens during or before the sheet.appendRow() step, the email sending part is never even attempted.

Please double-check that first! Let me know what you find.\n\nOption A (Easiest): Right-click on the sheet tab name and choose \"Rename\". Change it to exactly Sheet1.\nOption B: Go back to the Apps Script Editor (Extensions > Apps Script).

It should resolve the issue where clicking Submit did nothing.\n\nNext Step:\n\nYou should now deploy this specific file (index.html) to Netlify, replacing the previous contact-form-carrd.html file. (You might want to rename index.html back to contact-form-carrd.html before uploading to keep your Netlify file structure consistent, or adjust your iframe source URL later if you deploy it as index.html).\n\nAfter deploying, please test submitting the Contact Form again (try General Inquiry first). It should now either submit successfully or show you specific validation error messages below the fields if you left something blank.\n\nThe required attribute is removed from all input fields in the sections that become hidden.\nThe required attribute is added to the appropriate input fields in the section that becomes visible.\n\nAttachments: index-1942e05f35ab1937.html\n\n",

Sometimes these interfaces just behave better in Chrome.\n\nLet me know what you find checking the code and deployment settings, and if trying another browser for the logs makes any difference.

Both updated forms are now live on Netlify with the correct Google Apps Script connection and the submit button fix.\n\nCrucial Next Step: Test Thoroughly on Netlify\n\nBefore we embed these into your Carrd site, it's really important to test them directly on their Netlify URLs first.

For this to work correctly on Netlify, the thank-you.html file needs to be deployed at the root level of the same Netlify site where the forms are.\nHow did you deploy thank-you.html to Netlify? Was it part of the same folder/deployment as the forms, sitting alongside the /competition and /contact folders (if you used that structure)? Or did you deploy it separately?\n\n",

The JavaScript automatically takes whatever is in that competitions array and builds the dropdown menu when the page loads.\n\nTo Add: Add a new competition name inside single quotes (' '), separated by a comma, within the square brackets [ ]. Example: ['2025 Snowball', '2025 Skate KC', ..., 'New Competition Name']\nTo Remove: Delete the competition name (including the single quotes and the comma before or after it).

Example: ['2025 Snowball Challenge', '2025 Skate KC', ...]\nImportant: Make sure each competition name is enclosed in single quotes (' ') and separated by commas (,), except for the very last item in the list which doesn't need a comma after it.\n\n",

The instructions for Manus are purely about getting the Netlify-hosted files ready.\n\nDoes that clear up the plan and the purpose of the instructions for Manus?\n\nYou are right: The entire reason we went through the process of deploying these forms to Netlify was precisely because directly embedding Manus's original complex HTML + JavaScript into a Carrd Embed block did not work (Carrd blocked the necessary scripts for the dynamic features).\nNetlify + iframe is the Solution: Our agreed-upon solution was:\n\nHost the functional forms (HTML+CSS+JS) on Netlify.\nEmbed those live Netlify forms into your Carrd site using <iframe> elements.\n\n\nInstructions for Manus: The instructions I drafted for Manus were intended only for modifying the HTML files themselves. These modified files are the ones you will upload/deploy to Netlify. Manus doesn't need to do anything related to Carrd. (The filenames ending in -carrd.html were just what Manus happened to call them initially, but their destination is Netlify).\n\n",

Is there anything else you want to cover now, or shall we pause until you have the updated files?\n\nIn both HTML files, find the line near the bottom containing:\nconst scriptURL = \"YOUR_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL\";\nReplace the placeholder URL with this exact URL:\nhttps://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby-oQ6VL8VVD8HPov8YgIO_jxvCiNWfjmvI5JGPIDlfPljxoUZkikNwnTxPe08Fpc2E/exec\n\nReview the contact-form-carrd.html file. It appears to be missing the final \"Submit\" button (or potentially a \"Next\" button if it was intended to be multi-step, though Submit seems more likely for that form).\nPlease ensure there is a clearly visible and functional Submit button present on the contact form that triggers the form submission process defined in the script.\n\nData appears correctly in your Google Sheet.\nYou receive the email notifications.\nThe Contact Form submit button works.\n\n",

Make sure these exactly match the name attributes from your forms, in the order you want them recorded. Add a \"Timestamp\" header as the very first column.\n\nIn your new Google Sheet, click Extensions > Apps Script. A new browser tab will open with the script editor.\nGive the script project a name (e.g., \"Form Submission Handler\") by clicking \"Untitled project\".\n\nI will generate the necessary doPost(e) function code based on the field names you provide.\nYou will delete any placeholder code in the editor and paste my generated code in.\nWe'll quickly edit two lines in the code: the name of the sheet tab it should write to (usually Sheet1) and the email address where you want notifications sent.\n\nClick the floppy disk icon (\"Save project\").\n\nClick the blue \"Deploy\" button (top right).\nChoose \"New deployment\".\nClick the gear icon (\u2699\ufe0f) next to \"Select type\" and pick \"Web app\".\nFill in the details:\n\nDescription: Anything (e.g., \"Form handler\").\nExecute as: Me (your email).\nWho has access: Anyone.

Let's clarify exactly how these custom forms, which currently live on Netlify, will actually show up on your main samataganaphotography.com site (which is hosted by Carrd).\n\nAssistant: Okay, good question. Let's clarify exactly how these custom forms, which currently live on Netlify, will actually show up on your main samataganaphotography.com site (which is hosted by Carrd).\n\nSince Carrd doesn't let us directly paste complex HTML+JavaScript forms into its builder (as we discovered earlier), and your main domain points to Carrd, we need to use an <iframe>. Think of an iframe as cutting a window or portal in your Carrd page that looks through to the live form hosted on Netlify.\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step embedding process, which we'll do after we set up the Google Apps Script and update the forms on Netlify:\n\nFinalize Netlify Forms: First, we need to finish the Google Apps Script, get its unique URL, paste that URL into your form HTML files (competition-signup-form-carrd.html and contact-form-carrd.html), and re-upload/redeploy these updated files to Netlify. This ensures the forms can actually submit data correctly.\n\nGet Netlify URLs: Make sure you have the exact public URLs for your forms on Netlify. Based on our earlier deployment structure, these might be something like:\n\nEdit Your Carrd Site: Log in to the Carrd editor for samataganaphotography.com.\n\nNavigate to Form Locations: Go to the specific sections on your Carrd page where you want the forms to appear (e.g., your \"Sign-Up\" section, your \"Contact\" section).\n\nRemove Placeholders: Delete any existing temporary forms you might have in those spots.\n\nAdd Embed Element: In Carrd, add a new element using the + button and choose Embed.\n\nConfigure the Embed:\n\nPaste <iframe> Code: In the large Code text box, you will paste HTML code for an iframe.\n\nAdjust Height: The height values (1800px, 1200px) are just starting guesses. You will likely need to preview your Carrd site and adjust these pixel values up or down until the iframe is tall enough to show the whole form without cutting it off or leaving too much blank space. This often takes a bit of trial and error.\n\nPublish Carrd Site: Save the changes in Carrd and Publish.\n\nThe Key: This embedding step comes after we make sure the forms on Netlify are finalized with their backend connection (the Google Apps Script URL). Does this embedding process using the iframe make sense as the next step once the backend is ready?\n\nhttps://creative-banoffee-35a8d7.netlify.app/competition/ (or maybe .../competition-signup-form-carrd.html)\nhttps://creative-banoffee-35a8d7.netlify.app/contact/ (or maybe .../contact-form-carrd.html)\n(You'll need to use the actual URLs Netlify provided for your deployments).\n\nSet the Type to Code.\nSet the Style to Inline.\nLeave Label blank (usually).\n\nFor the Competition Form:\n<iframe\n  id=\"competition-form\"\n  src=\"PUT_YOUR_NETLIFY_COMPETITION_FORM_URL_HERE\"\n  style=\"width: 100%; height: 1800px; border: none; overflow: auto;\"\n  frameborder=\"0\">\n  Loading Competition Form...\n</iframe>\n\n\nFor the Contact Form:\n<iframe\n  id=\"contact-form\"\n  src=\"PUT_YOUR_NETLIFY_CONTACT_FORM_URL_HERE\"\n  style=\"width: 100%; height: 1200px; border: none; overflow: auto;\"\n  frameborder=\"0\">\n  Loading Contact Form...\n</iframe>\n\n",

Glad you made it back to the command center (aka the computer).\n\nBefore we dive into the Google Apps Script for the backend:\n\nAssuming you want to press on with the script setup for now:\n\nTo generate the correct Google Apps Script code that will capture all your form data into a Google Sheet and send you email notifications, I need to know exactly what data fields each form collects.\n\nCould you please open the final HTML files Manus gave you (competition-signup-form-carrd.html and contact-form-carrd.html) in a text editor (like TextEdit, Notepad, VS Code) and list out the name attributes for all the input fields (<input name=\"this_value\">), select fields (<select name=\"this_value\">), and text areas (<textarea name=\"this_value\">) in both forms?\n\nFor example, for the contact form, it might be something like:\nname, email, inquiryType, eventName, sessionType, message, etc.\n\nAnd for the competition form:\nparentName, parentEmail, parentPhone, skaterName1, skaterDOB1, skaterComp1, skaterEvents1, secondSkater, skaterName2, skaterDOB2, skaterComp2, skaterEvents2, ... (up to skater 5), comments, etc.\n\nOnce you provide those lists of name attributes, I can write the perfect script for you.\n\nQuick Reminder: You wanted me to remind you to tell Manus that the Contact Form seemed to be missing its main \"Next\" or \"Submit\" button. Do you want to quickly ping Manus about that now, or should we proceed with setting up the script backend first and address the button later?\n\n",

Moving a section shouldn't fundamentally change whether an anchor link (#about) works if the Scroll Point name and the link itself were correct.\n\nSometimes visual editors can get into slightly odd states, and an action like moving a major element can force them to recalculate element positions or regenerate the underlying code, inadvertently fixing a glitch that wasn't obvious.

Glad the /sign-up redirect worked perfectly after the upgrade. That solves the big legacy link problem cleanly.\n\nOkay, onto the new issue: an internal link to #about isn't working. This is almost certainly unrelated to the Pro Plus upgrade or the external redirect \u2013 it's usually down to how the link or the target section is set up inside the Carrd editor.\n\nHere are the most common reasons and how to check them:\n\nCheck the Link Source:\n\nCheck the Target Section:\n\nUsually, it's either a typo in the link URL or the target section doesn't have a correctly named Scroll Point control element associated with it. Double-check both the link source and the target section's Scroll Point name in the editor.\n\n(Regarding the cost: Totally fair to evaluate if $49/yr is worth it just for that redirect long-term. You know the Cloudflare setup is the alternative if you decide to downgrade later. But for now, you have a working solution with minimal hassle, which was the goal!)\n\nFind the button, text link, or navigation item that's supposed to link to your \"About\" section.\nClick on it in the editor. What exactly is entered in its URL or Link field? Is it precisely #about? (Check for typos, extra characters, or incorrect casing like #About).\n\nGo to the actual \"About\" section on your page in the Carrd editor.\nDoes this section have a \"Control\" element added to it?\nIf yes, is that Control element's \"Type\" set to \"Scroll Point\"?\nIf yes, what is the exact \"Name\" given to that Scroll Point? This name must exactly match what comes after the # in your link (e.g., if the Scroll Point Name is about-section, your link must be #about-section). Carrd usually normalizes these to lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.\n\n",

Solid choice.\n\nAssistant: Okay, decisive move! Upgrading to Pro Plus was definitely the path of least resistance to get that redirect handled natively within Carrd, minimizing the \"off-hours shit\" factor. Solid choice.\n\nNow, let's put that new feature to work:\n\nGo to your Carrd Dashboard for the samataganaphotography.com site.\n\nClick the \"Publish\" tab again (where you set up the custom domain).\n\nInside the Publish section, look for a \"Settings\" tab (it's usually right near where the DNS instructions were). Click on it.\n\nScroll down within the Settings tab. You should now see a section labeled \"Redirects\" (this was previously greyed out or hidden).\n\nIn the text box for Redirects, you need to add your rule. Carrd uses the format /[path] = #[section_id]. Add the following line:\n/sign-up = #sign-up\n\nOnce you've added that line, click the main \"Publish Changes\" button at the top of the Publish section.\n\nThis tells Carrd: \"Anyone visiting the /sign-up path should be immediately redirected internally to the #sign-up section of the page.\"\n\nSince this redirect is handled by Carrd directly (not DNS), it should take effect fairly quickly after you publish the changes.\n\nGo ahead and add that rule in the Redirects section and publish. Then, try visiting samataganaphotography.com/sign-up (the old link) and see if it correctly bumps you to the right section on your site (/#sign-up). Let me know!\n\n(Assumption: The ID of your sign-up section in the Carrd editor is actually sign-up. If you named it something different, like signup or sign_up, use that name after the # instead. Double-check the section's ID in the editor if you're unsure.)\n\n",

You've pinpointed it.\n\nAssistant: Yes, exactly.

You can handle the tech, but you want this part of your life to be the easy button, not another tech project requiring troubleshooting and deep dives outside of work hours. Minimum hassle, maximum function is the name of the game here. Makes perfect sense.\n\nOkay, with that filter (\"minimum off-hours shit\"), let's look at the options again, especially regarding that redirect for /sign-up.\n\nI checked Carrd's official documentation and features for their plans:\n\nSo, here are the most viable paths, ordered by likely lowest \"off-hours hassle\":\n\nRecommendation based on your preference:\n\nGiven you want the path of least resistance outside your day job, upgrading to Carrd Pro Plus seems like the most direct fit if the $49/year cost is acceptable. It requires the least technical fiddling from you.\n\nIf the cost is a barrier, then the Cloudflare option is the next best \u2013 it solves the problem effectively for free, but you'd have to invest that initial setup time.\n\nDoes the \"pay $49/year on Carrd to make it easy\" option sound like the winner here, or are you leaning towards the free-but-more-setup Cloudflare route?\n\nCarrd Pro Plus ($49/year): This plan explicitly includes a \"Redirects\" feature. The documentation shows examples precisely for your use case: redirecting a \"slash\" URL path (like /sign-up) to an internal section anchor (like =#sign-up). It handles these as proper 301 redirects.\n\nEffort: Minimal. Pay the fee, go into Carrd's site settings, find the \"Redirects\" section, and add a rule like /sign-up -> =#sign-up.\nPros: Solves the problem using built-in tools. Keeps your existing site. Zero extra platforms to manage. Likely the fastest solution time-wise.\nCons: Costs $49/year.\n\nEffort: Moderate initial setup. Sign up for Cloudflare, change nameservers at Hover again (to point to Cloudflare), replicate your current DNS records (A, CNAME, MX) within Cloudflare, create a Page Rule or Redirect Rule for /sign-up -> /#sign-up. Maybe 1-2 hours of focused setup.\nPros: Fixes the problem robustly, potentially free, adds performance/security benefits.\nCons: Requires that initial setup block which might feel like \"work\", adds another service dashboard to potentially check later if issues arise.\n\nEffort: High initial effort. Designing, building, migrating content.\nPros: Solves the redirect issue natively, potentially more features long-term.\nCons: Exactly the kind of \"off-hours shit\" project it sounds like you want to avoid right now.\n\n",

Carrd is fantastic for its speed and simplicity for single-page sites, but that simplicity comes with trade-offs, and handling specific path redirects (/sign-up -> /#sign-up) is one of its known limitations unless you potentially jump to higher tiers or use external tools.\n\nLet's quickly map out the landscape based on what you need:\n\nThe Core Problem: You need samataganaphotography.com/sign-up to reliably redirect to the /#sign-up section of your Carrd site.\n\nOption A: Stick with Carrd (Workarounds/Upgrades)\n\nOption B: Rebuild on a Platform with Native Redirects\n\nThe Decision Point:\n\nThere's no wrong answer, just different paths with different effort levels.

People have samataganaphotography.com/sign-up bookmarked or linked elsewhere, and now it's broken because Carrd uses /#sign-up. That is a significant problem. My apologies, I didn't grasp the legacy link issue initially.\n\nYou are right to be bothered by this. We need a way to catch anyone trying to visit the old /sign-up URL and redirect them automatically to the new /#sign-up section on your Carrd site.\n\nThe Challenge:\n\nThe \"Correct\" Solution (Requires an Extra Step):\n\nThe standard way to fix this kind of path-specific broken link is to use a service that sits between your users and your Carrd hosting, which can handle sophisticated redirect rules. The most common and effective way to do this is using Cloudflare:\n\nOther Options (Less Ideal):\n\nRecommendation:\n\nWhile it adds a step we didn't initially plan for, setting up Cloudflare is the most robust and professional way to solve the broken legacy /sign-up link problem.\n\nGiven how important maintaining that link is, do you want to proceed with setting up Cloudflare to implement this redirect? It will involve changing nameservers one more time, but it will fix the root problem correctly.\n\nCarrd: As we discussed, Carrd itself, being a single-page platform managed by them, doesn't offer built-in tools to handle redirects for specific paths like /sign-up that don't actually exist as separate pages on their system.\nHover DNS/Forwarding: Standard DNS records and Hover's basic domain forwarding work at the domain level (e.g., redirecting domain A to domain B), they can't typically manage redirects based on specific paths within a domain (like /sign-up vs. /contact).\n\nManual Link Updates: Find everywhere the old /sign-up link exists (social media, emails, etc.) and manually update it to /#sign-up. Doesn't help people with old bookmarks.\nJavaScript Hack: Potentially add JavaScript to your Carrd site to detect if someone landed in a way that implies they wanted /sign-up and redirect them. This is generally unreliable, bad for SEO, and might not even be feasible depending on Carrd's code injection limits.\n\n",

You'd prefer https://samataganaphotography.com/sign-up.\n\nThat difference comes down to how Carrd structures its sites:\n\nThe Issue: Because Carrd is fundamentally designed around that single-page model, its internal links between sections use the # (hash) method. It doesn't typically create separate pages that would allow for the /sign-up URL structure.\n\nBottom Line: Getting that clean /sign-up URL instead of /#sign-up is generally not something Carrd supports due to its core architecture. The /#sign-up is the standard way Carrd handles linking to different sections within your site.\n\nWhile it might not be the absolute prettiest URL aesthetically, it's functionally how Carrd works. Unless you were planning to move away from Carrd to a multi-page platform (which seems like massive overkill right now), the /#sign-up structure is likely what we need to work with for internal site navigation.\n\nDoes that distinction make sense?

You're right, looking back at the clear screenshot from Carrd (IMG_0074.jpg), the target for the CNAME record is shown as samataganaphotography.com. with a period at the end.\n\nHere's the deal with that trailing period:\n\nRecommendation:\n\nLeave the CNAME value in Hover as it is currently set (samataganaphotography.com without the trailing dot - as shown in IMG_0075.jpg).

It shows you're paying close attention to the details. For now, let's assume Hover handles it correctly without the dot.\n\nDNS Tech Speak: In formal DNS zone file syntax, a trailing dot signifies the end of a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). It means the name is absolute and shouldn't have the current zone appended.\nWeb Interfaces: However, most modern DNS management interfaces (like Hover's) are designed to be user-friendly. They usually automatically handle whether that trailing dot is needed or not behind the scenes. If you enter samataganaphotography.com (without the dot), Hover typically understands you mean the absolute FQDN and formats the actual DNS record correctly on their end.\nPotential Issues: Sometimes, manually adding the trailing dot in a web interface can actually cause problems, leading the system to interpret it incorrectly (like trying to create samataganaphotography.com.samataganaphotography.com).\n\n",

I understand the frustration seeing an error page, but let's look at the source of the instruction.\n\nAssistant: Hold on, let's trace this back carefully. I understand the frustration seeing an error page, but let's look at the source of the instruction.\n\nCarrd's Instructions: In your first screenshot showing the Carrd setup (IMG_0059.jpg), Carrd explicitly told you to set the following DNS records:\n\nYour DNS Before the Change: After you fixed the nameservers, your Hover DNS (IMG_0063.jpg) showed an A record for @ pointing to 172.66.0.70. This 172.66.0.70 IP is not the one Carrd instructed you to use. It was likely a default Hover parking IP or a leftover record. Pointing your domain there would not load your Carrd site.\n\nMy Instruction & Your Change: Based directly on Carrd's requirement for 192.241.141.162, I guided you to edit that existing A record (which was pointing to the incorrect 172.66.0.70) and change its value to 192.241.141.162. Your screenshot IMG_0064.jpg confirms you successfully made this change, matching Carrd's instructions.\n\nConclusion: We changed the A record from an incorrect value (172.66.0.70) to the value explicitly required by Carrd (192.241.141.162).\n\nThe Cloudways 403 error you're seeing now actually confirms that the DNS is correctly pointing to the IP address Carrd specified (192.241.141.162). The error happens because, although the internet is sending traffic to the right server complex (Cloudways via that IP), the final step of mapping your specific domain name to your specific Carrd site within Carrd's/Cloudways' system hasn't finished yet. That mapping was initiated when you clicked \"Save Changes\" in Carrd.\n\nSo, the A record change was necessary and correct according to Carrd's instructions. The current error is the next step in the process \u2013 waiting for Carrd's backend to catch up. Does that make sense? We followed Carrd's lead precisely on that IP address.\n\nType: A | Host: @ | Value: 192.241.141.162\nType: CNAME | Host: www | Value: samataganaphotography.com\n\n",

Clicking it again definitely ensures Carrd got the signal after your Hover DNS was correct.\n\nSo, what happens now:\n\nThe Annoying Part: Timing\n\nThis internal verification, mapping, and SSL setup on Carrd's side can take anywhere from 15 minutes to sometimes a couple of hours. It's often less predictable than the main DNS propagation.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nLet me know what happens after about an hour. Hopefully, you'll see your site live! If it's still showing the Cloudways error after 2-3 hours, then we might need to poke Carrd support.\n\nWait: Give it at least 30-60 minutes from when you just clicked \"Save Changes.\"\nCheck Periodically: Try loading samataganaphotography.com in your browser again after that wait. You might need to do a hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear your browser cache if it still shows the old error initially.\nPatience: Your Hover DNS setup is correct.

So, you've likely set up the \"correct\" type implicitly. The lack of a path forwarding option usually just means all requests to samcantskate.com (regardless of path) will land on the homepage you specified.\n\nOne Small Tweak Needed:\n\nThis ensures the redirect immediately aims for the secure version of your site.\n\n(And noted on the app prompt \u2013 nothing quite like a persistent banner for an app you find janky.

You're correct \u2013 some hosting tools use less ideal methods like masked forwarding or temporary redirects.

You're correct \u2013 some hosting tools use less ideal methods like masked forwarding or temporary redirects. We want a clean, permanent (301) redirect handled at the domain level, which tells search engines and browsers the move is official. Hover's built-in forwarding tool is designed for exactly this.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do it correctly in Hover:\n\nWhat Hover Does: Behind the scenes, Hover will automatically set up the necessary DNS records (usually pointing samcantskate.com to their own forwarding servers) that perform the 301 redirect to your specified destination. You typically don't need to manually create A or CNAME records when using the dedicated forwarding tool.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nGo ahead and set that up in Hover. Let me know if the options look different than described.\n\nGo to your \"Domains\" list in Hover.\nClick on the domain samcantskate.com.\n\nLook for the \"FORWARDS\" section (based on your earlier screenshot IMG_0060.jpg, this section is clearly visible on the domain overview page).\nClick the button labeled \"FORWARD THIS DOMAIN\".\n\nDestination URL / Forward To: Enter the full URL you want to redirect to. Use the secure version: https://samataganaphotography.com\nRedirect Type: Make sure \"Permanent (301)\" is selected. This is crucial for doing it \"correctly\" for SEO and browser behavior. It's usually the default.\nPath Forwarding (Optional but Recommended): Look for an option like \"Forward with path\", \"Keep path info\", or similar. If you see it, enable it. This means samcantskate.com/cool-photo would redirect to samataganaphotography.com/cool-photo instead of just the homepage. If you don't see this option, Hover might do it automatically or not support it (less common nowadays).\n\nPropagation: Just like other DNS changes, allow some time (usually 15 minutes to an hour) for the forward to become active.\nTest: After waiting a bit, type samcantskate.com into your browser's address bar and hit Enter. It should automatically redirect you to https://samataganaphotography.com. Also try www.samcantskate.com to ensure it redirects too.\n\n",

That new screenshot confirms it perfectly.\n\nUnder \"NAMESERVERS\" it clearly lists:\n\nThat means your domain's DNS is still being controlled by Wix.\n\nHere's the fix:\n\nOnce you save these changes, Hover will start managing your DNS. Remember the propagation time \u2013 it might take 30 mins to a few hours for the change to be recognized everywhere.\n\nAfter you've done this (and waited a bit):\n\nLet me know when you've clicked that \"EDIT\" button and what options you see for changing the nameservers.\n\nns8.wixdns.net\nns9.wixdns.net\n\nns1.hover.com\nns2.hover.com\n\nGo back to the \"DNS\" tab in Hover.

Look at the warning message at the top of your Hover DNS page:\n\n\"This domain is using third-party nameservers. DNS records added here won't have an effect.\"\n\nThis is the problem. Your domain isn't actually using Hover to manage its DNS yet, even though the domain itself might be transferred. It's likely still pointing to GoDaddy's nameservers (or wherever it was pointed before). Any changes you make on this DNS page will be completely ignored until you fix the nameservers.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to do first:\n\nImportant: Changing nameservers also involves propagation time, similar to DNS records, maybe 30 minutes to a few hours.\n\nAfter you have successfully changed the nameservers back to Hover's defaults (and the warning message on the DNS tab disappears):\n\nSummary of Action:\n\nLet me know when you've updated the nameservers. That's the critical first step.\n\nOkay, got the first screenshot. (Yeah, the one-at-a-time upload is... a choice.)\n\nBased on that image, Carrd requires these two specific records to be set up at Hover:\n\nNow, let's configure these in Hover (on your iPad):\n\nNext Steps:\n\nLet me know once you've updated the records in Hover.\n\nYou have three A records for Host @. You only need one pointing to Carrd.\nEdit one of them. Change its Value / IP Address to 192.241.141.162 (the Carrd IP).\nDelete the other two A records for Host @ (the ones pointing to 216.40.34.41 and 172.66.0.70).\n\nYou already have CNAME www samataganaphotography.com. This is correct according to Carrd's instructions. Just leave it as is.\n\nType: A\nHost: @ (This represents your root domain)\nValue / IP Address: 192.241.141.162\n\nType: CNAME\nHost: www\nValue / Target: samataganaphotography.com\n\nLook for any existing records with Type A and Host @.\nIf one exists, click \"Edit\". Change the Value / IP Address to 192.241.141.162.\nIf multiple A records exist for @, delete the extra ones. You only want this single one pointing to Carrd's IP.\nIf no A record exists for @, click \"Add Record\". Select Type A, enter Host @, and enter Value 192.241.141.162.\nSave the change for this record.\n\nLook for any existing records (could be A or CNAME) with Host www.\nIf one exists, click \"Edit\". Change the Type to CNAME and set the Value / Target to samataganaphotography.com.\nIf no record exists for www, click \"Add Record\". Select Type CNAME, enter Host www, and enter Value samataganaphotography.com.\nSave the change for this record.\n\nWait: DNS propagation takes time. As Carrd noted, allow up to an hour (sometimes more, sometimes less) for the changes to take effect globally.\nCheck: After an hour or so, try visiting http://samataganaphotography.com (use HTTP first, as SSL might take longer) to see if it loads your Carrd site. Eventually, https://samataganaphotography.com should work with SSL.\n\nAttachments: IMG_0058-a8f98a4d0b970f12.jpg, IMG_0059-e4a119d644ca7ab5.jpg\n\n",

Hopefully I can do most of this on my iPadMay 2, 2025, 2:29:14\u202fPM CDTOkay, let's get samataganaphotography.com pointed at your Carrd site.\n\nAssistant: Okay, let's get samataganaphotography.com pointed at your Carrd site.\n\nFirst, quick check: Has Hover officially confirmed the domain transfer is complete and the domain is active in your Hover account? (DNS changes won't work until it's fully under their control).\n\nWorking from the iPad: It should be possible. Logging into Hover and editing DNS records usually works fine in a mobile browser (like Safari on iPadOS), though the interface might feel a bit cramped compared to a desktop. We can give it a shot.\n\nHere's the crucial first step (Do this before touching Hover DNS):\n\nCarrd will now display the exact DNS records it requires you to set up at Hover. It will typically look something like this (but use the values Carrd shows you, not necessarily these examples):\n\nAction for You: Please go through those steps in Carrd first. Then, tell me the exact DNS records (Host, Type, Value) that Carrd instructs you to add at Hover.\n\nOnce you give me those specific instructions from Carrd, I'll guide you through adding them in your Hover account via the iPad browser.\n\nTwo A records for the root domain (@):\n\nHost: @ Type: A Value: [IP Address 1 provided by Carrd]\nHost: @ Type: A Value: [IP Address 2 provided by Carrd]\n\n\nPossibly a CNAME record for www:\n\nHost: www Type: CNAME Value: [Your root domain, e.g., samataganaphotography.com, or a Carrd-specific address]\n\nHost: @ Type: A Value: [IP Address 1 provided by Carrd]\nHost: @ Type: A Value: [IP Address 2 provided by Carrd]\n\nHost: www Type: CNAME Value: [Your root domain, e.g., samataganaphotography.com, or a Carrd-specific address]\n\n",
