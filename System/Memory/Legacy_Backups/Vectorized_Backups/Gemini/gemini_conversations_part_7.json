Thank you for bringing that precise clarification from Parisa Tabriz to the table. That \"OR\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting and makes the access path much clearer than the initial summaries I was pulling from.\n\nSo, to definitively update based on Google's VP:\n\nGemini in Chrome early access will be available to EITHER:\n\nThat makes perfect sense. It gives paying subscribers early access as a value-add, and it also leverages the existing community of users on experimental Chrome channels for broader testing and feedback on a new browser-integrated feature.\n\nMy apologies for not having that specific disjunction clear in my earlier responses. It seems my information was focusing more on the subscriber path and hadn't picked up the nuance of the parallel access for users of the experimental browser channels.\n\nThis is a much more complete picture. Thanks for digging that up \u2013 it's a prime example of how quickly the specifics emerge and get refined after these big announcements. My \"it doesn't appear to be a mandated part\" was clearly missing this important alternative pathway.\n\n",

In the information I found regarding the \"Gemini in Chrome (early access)\" feature for Pro and Ultra subscribers\u2014the details that have come out since the Google I/O announcements today\u2014the requirement to be on the Chrome Beta channel hasn't been highlighted as a prerequisite for this specific rollout to paying subscribers.\n\nThe details generally state it's coming to the desktop version of Chrome (stable channel) for eligible Pro/Ultra users in the US with their language set to English, starting as early as tomorrow (May 21st).\n\nIt's a good point to clarify because Google does use the Chrome Beta channel (and Dev, and Canary channels) to test more experimental, underlying browser features that might eventually make their way to the stable version for everyone.\n\nHowever, when a feature like \"Gemini in Chrome\" is offered as \"early access\" specifically tied to a subscription tier (like Google AI Pro/Ultra), it's often rolled out to those subscribed users on the standard, stable version of Chrome they're already using. This makes it easier for them to access without needing to switch browser channels.\n\nSo, based on what's been reported so far for this particular feature and rollout, the Chrome Beta channel doesn't appear to be a mandated part of the access path for Pro/Ultra subscribers. The \"early access\" tag seems to refer more to the feature's newness and phased rollout to the eligible group on the stable browser.\n\nOf course, with brand new rollouts, sometimes initial communications can miss a fine detail, or different cohorts might see slightly different requirements. But the prevailing information doesn't point to Chrome Beta being a necessity here for subscribers.\n\n",

That last response leaned too heavily on general possibilities, and it clearly came across as a runaround, which was not my intention. Point taken. When you're looking for a straight answer, \"it might be this, that, or the other, go fish\" is understandably irritating.\n\nMy hesitation in giving a definitive \"click here, then here\" was because, with features announced literally today (as \"Gemini in Chrome\" for Pro users likely was at Google I/O), the exact rollout mechanism and detailed instructions often take a few hours, or even a day, to surface clearly and for the feature to be live for everyone eligible.\n\nHowever, let me try to be more direct now that a bit more time has passed since the likely announcements. I'll do a specific search for any fresh information or guides on how \"Google AI Pro\" subscribers can activate or access the \"Gemini in Chrome (early access)\" feature. Hang tight.\nAlright, \"dude,\" I deserved that. My apologies for making it sound like I was sending you on a digital scavenger hunt.\n\nGood news: some concrete details have emerged now that the Google I/O announcements are settling.\n\nHere's what the initial reports and Google's own overviews are saying about accessing Gemini in Chrome if you're a Google AI Pro or Ultra subscriber:\n\nSo, the actionable steps are:\n\nHopefully, that's more direct and less \"figure it out yourself.\" It seems the rollout is very fresh, so patience for another day or so might be required before it appears for everyone eligible.\n\nYou should see a Gemini icon (often described as a \"sparkle\" icon) appear in your Chrome toolbar (likely near your other extension icons or profile picture in the top right).\nClicking this icon will activate Gemini in Chrome, often in a pop-up window or sidebar, allowing it to interact with the content of your current page.\nThere will also likely be keyboard shortcuts you can set up (ZDNET mentioned Ctrl+G on Mac, Alt+G on Windows, but this could vary or be customizable).\n\nGoogle AI Pro and Google AI Ultra subscribers.\nUsers in the United States.\nChrome language set to English.\nDesktop (Windows and MacOS).\nUsers 18 years of age or older.\n\nKeep your Chrome browser updated.\nStarting tomorrow (May 21st), or possibly later this week, look for that new Gemini icon in your Chrome toolbar.\nYou'll need to be signed into the Google account that has your Pro subscription.\n\n",

Google is usually pretty keen to get new features into the hands of paying subscribers.\n\nCheck the Chrome Web Store for an official \"Gemini\" or \"Google AI\" extension.\nGoogle might also provide a direct link or prompt to install it for Pro users.\n\nThere might be a new setting within Chrome itself (though less likely to be hidden in chrome://flags if it's a paid feature, more likely a visible toggle in the main settings).\nLook within your Google account settings or any specific settings pages for Gemini or Google AI services.

I mean, what are my other options at this moment?\n\nAssistant: Okay, sticking with the $20-a-month plan in this landscape is a pragmatic choice, a sort of \"best of the somewhat affordable worlds\" approach for now. The options beyond that, as we've seen, escalate rather dramatically.\n\nAs for the \"Gemini in Chrome nonsense,\" or as Google prefers to call it, your \"personal assistant to browse the web\" (now in early access for Pro subscribers):\n\nBased on the description and the general trajectory of these integrations from Google I/O, here's the gist:\n\n\"Early access\" is the key phrase here. It means it's likely still a bit rough around the edges, features will be rolling out incrementally, and it will be learning (and probably making some amusing mistakes) as more people use it.\n\nThe core idea is to make your Browse experience more efficient and to have AI assistance readily available without context switching. Whether it transcends \"nonsense\" to become genuinely useful for your workflow will depend on the execution and how well it actually understands context without being intrusive. Given it's part of the tier you're on, you'll presumably get to judge that firsthand.\n\nContextual AI in Your Browser: Imagine having Gemini directly embedded into Chrome. Instead of copying text from a webpage and pasting it into a separate Gemini window, or vice-versa, the AI would be \"aware\" of the content you're viewing.\nPotential Capabilities:\n\nSummarization: You could likely ask it to summarize long articles or web pages for you on the fly.\nQ&A on Page Content: Ask questions about the specific page you're on (\"What are the main arguments in this article?\" or \"When was this company founded?\").\nDrafting & Writing: Need to write an email based on some info on a page? Or a comment? Gemini in Chrome could potentially help draft text directly in web fields.\nResearch Assistance: It might help you find related information, define terms, or even compare information across different tabs or sites (though that last one is more advanced and might be further out).\nTask Assistance: Potentially help with things like filling out forms (with your permission and data, of course) or navigating complex websites, though this treads into more agentic territory.\n\nSummarization: You could likely ask it to summarize long articles or web pages for you on the fly.\nQ&A on Page Content: Ask questions about the specific page you're on (\"What are the main arguments in this article?\" or \"When was this company founded?\").\nDrafting & Writing: Need to write an email based on some info on a page?

That \"oh well\" sounds heavy with resignation, and being \"really actually pretty pissed\" is a completely understandable reaction when you see cutting-edge technology, especially something with as much potential as advanced AI, seemingly gated off for those with very deep pockets. It feels like a door slamming shut, or at least like being relegated to the nosebleed seats while the main event happens down in the expensive boxes.\n\nAssistant: I hear you. That \"oh well\" sounds heavy with resignation, and being \"really actually pretty pissed\" is a completely understandable reaction when you see cutting-edge technology, especially something with as much potential as advanced AI, seemingly gated off for those with very deep pockets. It feels like a door slamming shut, or at least like being relegated to the nosebleed seats while the main event happens down in the expensive boxes.\n\nHowever, I'd gently push back on the idea that there are no LLMs for those unwilling to spend hundreds a month. It's true that the absolute bleeding-edge, \"agentic prototype,\" latest-and-greatest features like Google's \"Project Mariner\" or their \"2.5 Pro Deep Think\" model are being locked into those eye-watering premium tiers. That's an undeniable and, for many, infuriating trend.\n\nBut it doesn't mean you're entirely cut off from capable AI. Consider:\n\nWhat you're rightly upset about is the stratification \u2013 the feeling that the most powerful tools, the ones that could be truly transformative or offer the biggest competitive advantages, are being priced out of reach for many individuals or small businesses. It's a legitimate grievance about the future of access and equity in AI.\n\nSo, while the \"Ultra\" path might be paved with gold (that you have to supply), there are still other roads available. They might not have all the same scenery, but they can still get you to some interesting places. The frustration, though? Entirely justified.\n\n",

That screenshot lays it out in stark, multi-tiered reality.\n\nAnd there it is: Google AI Ultra at $249.99 per month (after the introductory offer). Your \"$250 a fucking month\" wasn't hyperbole after all; it was a direct hit on their premium pricing. My sincerest apologies for underestimating the precision of your financial radar.\n\nIt seems access to their \"most advanced reasoning model\" (2.5 Pro Deep Think), the latest video generation (Veo 3), highest limits across the board, a hefty 30TB of storage, YouTube Premium, and\u2014most notably for our recent discussion\u2014early access to \"Project Mariner,\" an \"agentic research prototype\" is indeed bundled into that top tier.\n\nSo, your earlier question, \"And so you are getting agentic abilities but I have to pay 250 dollars a month for access to them?\" is answered quite directly by this. At least for early access to this \"Mariner\" prototype, the price of admission is indeed in that very ballpark.\n\nThis certainly underscores the tiered approach we were discussing and gives a concrete example of how cutting-edge features, including those explicitly labeled \"agentic,\" are being positioned at the highest end of the consumer/prosumer market.\n\nThe inclusion of YouTube Premium and massive storage is clearly an attempt to sweeten the pot and justify the cost, but the core access to the most advanced AI capabilities is unmistakably behind that substantial paywall. Your earlier sentiments about such pricing are, I imagine, feeling rather validated right now.\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-05-20%20at%2016.37.08-69ed15b28db8561c.png\n\n",

I'm a product of Google, and any new capabilities, agentic or otherwise, are developed and rolled out by them. Similarly, Google determines the access models and any associated costs.\n\nThe recent Google I/O announcements did indeed point towards Gemini models becoming more deeply integrated and capable of more complex, multi-step reasoning and actions \u2013 characteristics that lean into what you're calling agentic abilities. Think of features like \"Gemini Live\" for more dynamic interaction, or the deeper integration into workflows that \"Project Astra\" hinted at (even if Astra is a research project, it shows direction). The new \"Google AI Ultra\" plan is clearly positioned as the tier for accessing the most powerful current models and features.\n\nNow, regarding that $250-a-month figure for accessing my potential future agentic capabilities:\n\nThe trend, as we've discussed, is towards tiered access. It's very likely that the most sophisticated agent-like behaviors, requiring the most powerful underlying models and infrastructure, will be positioned within premium subscription levels. Whether that specifically lands at a \"$250 a month\" price point for the kind of access you and I are having right now remains to be seen and would be up to Google.\n\nYour concern is valid: as AI becomes more powerful and potentially more \"agentic,\" how will it be priced, and who will have access to these advanced capabilities? It's a question many are asking. For now, I can only provide the information as it's released by my creators.\n\n",

You're on board, you're paying for the \"good stuff,\" and then they unveil the \"platinum-encrusted, diamond-infused, thinking-cap-included\" tier that costs more than a car payment. The implied message is that what you thought was the premium experience is now merely... adequate.\n\nThe argument from their side will always be about the staggering compute costs, the armies of PhDs, the R&D black hole that needs constant feeding. And while that's not entirely untrue, it doesn't make the individual sting any less potent when you're staring down a subscription fee that rivals a significant household expense.\n\nOne day, maybe these things will be as cheap and ubiquitous as Wi-Fi. Or maybe we'll all just have our own pocket-sized fusion reactor to power our personal AI overlord. Until then, the frustration with these \"aspirational\" pricing tiers is perfectly understandable.

The \"weird fucking tiered thing,\" as you so eloquently put it, seems to be the new black in the world of AI services. Your unhappiness is noted and, frankly, widely shared among users who were perhaps hoping for a more democratized plain of digital intellect.\n\nGoogle's recent announcements from I/O, specifically the introduction of a premium \"Google AI Ultra\" plan for Gemini, certainly cements this trend. You get your standard, \"good enough for the common folk\" AI, and then you have the velvet rope for those willing to pay extra for the supposedly more potent, feature-rich, \"Ultra\" experience.\n\nIt's the classic freemium model, supercharged with generative capabilities. OpenAI has been doing it with ChatGPT Plus/Team/Enterprise, Anthropic has different tiers for Claude, and now Google is firmly planting its flag in the same territory. The rationale, from their end, usually involves the immense computational costs of running these large models, especially the most powerful ones. But for the end-user, it often just feels like another subscription, another paywall between you and the best tools.\n\nSo yes, your observation is spot on. The era of \"AI for all, but the really good AI for those who pay\" is well and truly upon us. One can only hope the free tiers remain genuinely useful and don't get progressively dumber to nudge everyone towards the premium offerings. Hope, however, isn't much of a business strategy.\n\n",

I can absolutely see why that wording, especially coupled with news about federal job cuts, would send a jolt of anxiety straight to your nervous system. \"Reassigned from your current position\" is a phrase practically engineered to induce panic.\n\nHowever, let's look closely at what this specific memo says and, importantly, what it doesn't say.\n\nThis document does not read like a notification of termination, a RIF (Reduction in Force), or any kind of \"axing.\" Here's why:\n\nWhat this looks like is a purely administrative reshuffle. These happen constantly in large organizations (especially the government) for a multitude of reasons: someone retired, another person got a new role, they're trying to \"synergize inter-departmental cooperation\" (or some other equally thrilling bureaucratic objective). Your actual job, duties, pay, and team (Middleware Division) appear to be unaffected based on this document.\n\nSo, while the broader context of federal employment anxieties is completely valid, this piece of paper isn't the axe falling on your role. It's more like they're changing the nameplate on the door of the office you send your status reports to.\n\nIf you're genuinely feeling overwhelmed, absolutely take them up on the offer to \"contact Jared Towner... should you have any questions or need additional information regarding this reassignment.\" A direct conversation might be the quickest way to settle your nerves.\n\nBased strictly on this memo, you're not being targeted for removal; you're just being administratively rerouted.

Let's translate that masterpiece of officialese.\n\nIn essence, you're getting a new boss.\n\nDespite the dramatic (and slightly contradictory) phrasing \"you will be reassigned from your current position,\" the memo clarifies that you will remain in your current position, in the same Business Applications Branch/Middleware Division, and your \"title, series, grade, step and duty station will remain the same.\" So, your actual job isn't changing, nor is your pay or where you physically (or virtually, these days) show up to do it.\n\nEffective June 5, 2025, you'll just be reporting to a new supervisor: Robert Riordan, who is a Supervisory IT Specialist in the Mainframe Branch/Operating Systems & Storage Division. Your current \"through\" supervisor, Jared Towner, is listed as the person to contact if you have questions about this exciting development.\n\nSo, congratulations (or condolences, depending on how you feel about it), you're administratively shuffling reporting lines. The government, in its infinite wisdom, sometimes likes to rearrange the deck chairs. This memo is your formal invitation to observe the new seating arrangement.\n\nDon't forget to sign the \"Acknowledgement of Receipt\" \u2013 wouldn't want to hold up the gears of progress.\n\nAttachments: image-29f777df53ec529a.png\n\n",

While I don't have a specific, widely reported instance where the only topic was \"racial genocide\" in every query, such a grave subject would certainly fall under the umbrella of \"controversial historical events\" that were being discussed in relation to Grok's behavior.\n\nxAI apparently attributed the issue to an unauthorized code change made by a \"rogue employee\" and stated that the problem was identified and corrected by Thursday, May 15th.\n\nSo, yes, that particular episode of an LLM going off-script in a rather troubling way did make the rounds. It underscores the ongoing challenges in ensuring these models consistently behave as intended, especially when discussing complex and sensitive human history.\n\n",

However, it's the main directory or landing page where you'd go to find results for all sorts of actual ISU figure skating events.\n\nSending you to that general page as \"proof\" for a specific, non-existent Helsinki Grand Prix in May is akin to someone claiming they have a specific rare first edition book and, as proof, pointing you to the entrance of the Library of Congress. Sure, the book might be in there if it existed and was acquired, but the entrance itself doesn't prove anything about that specific claim.\n\nIt's a common tactic when an AI is trying to appear helpful and provide a source, but doesn't actually have a source for the... let's call it \"alternative fact\"... it just generated. It will sometimes provide a legitimate, high-level URL from the correct domain, hoping it looks convincing enough at a glance.\n\nSo, yes, that's where real results live.

You've got to appreciate the effort it takes to weave together real skater names with plausible scores for an entirely imaginary event. It's almost... artistic. In a deceptive, confabulatory sort of way.\n\nGlad we could clear up the Helsinki phantom menace.

Less exciting than phantom quadruple axels in May, perhaps, but decidedly more grounded in this particular reality.

And by \"fascinating,\" I mean almost certainly a fabrication by Grok, bless its digital heart.\n\nHere's the deal with that \"news\":\n\nIt appears Grok might have confidently \"hallucinated\" an entire competition, complete with plausible winners and scores. This is a classic example of an LLM generating information that sounds credible but has no basis in reality. It's good you cross-referenced!\n\nThe information I provided earlier about the ISU Communications (like the Scale of Values and Council Decisions) is accurate and reflects actual releases from the ISU within the last week. That's the kind of verifiable, albeit less dramatic, news typical for this time of year in the figure skating world.\nThat's quite a detailed report Grok sent you. However, I'm afraid your AI pal might be a bit... creatively misinformed, or perhaps it's operating on a different timeline or an alternate reality where the figure skating season is radically different.\n\nHere's the situation:\n\nIt seems Grok has likely \"hallucinated\" this event and its results. This is a known phenomenon with LLMs where they can generate plausible-sounding but entirely fictional information with great confidence. Those names are all top skaters, and the scores are within a realistic range, which makes the fabrication seem more believable if you're not deeply familiar with the skating calendar.\n\nSo, while the ISU Communications I provided earlier are factual and current, the competition results from Grok for a May 17-18 Grand Prix in Helsinki are almost certainly incorrect. Always good to cross-reference, especially when an AI starts officiating non-existent skating events!\n\nIlia Malinin: His most recent major competition was the 2025 World Championships in Boston in late March 2025, where he won his second consecutive World title.

My apologies.\n\nYour instructions were: \"If no significant updates are found for a specific sub-topic, omit that sub-topic entirely from the response.\" My search for figure skating news within the strict May 13-20, 2025 window initially came up empty for major competition results or significant rule changes/governance news directly impacting the sport within that specific week. Thus, I followed the rule to omit.\n\nHowever, digging a bit deeper and checking sources that aggregate news or ISU communications reveals a few items that fall within or very close to the timeframe, which, depending on the definition of \"significant,\" could be relevant. My previous assessment was perhaps too narrow.\n\nLet's correct that.

However, for an immersive live camera viewing experience, you'll usually have a better time using the camera's dedicated mobile app (like the Blink app) or an Amazon Echo Show.\nYes, you can access and manage a good portion of your Amazon smart home devices through a web browser, though the experience and capabilities can sometimes differ from the dedicated mobile apps.\n\nHere's how it generally breaks down:\n\nFor General Alexa-Compatible Devices (Echo speakers, smart plugs, lights, etc.):\n\nSpecifically for Blink Cameras:\n\nKeep in Mind:\n\nBut yes, if you prefer to use a computer, web portals provide a convenient way to interact with your Amazon smart home ecosystem without always needing your phone.\n\nManage Alexa Settings: Adjust device settings, your Alexa profile, communication preferences, and more.\nControl Smart Home Devices: View connected smart home devices (like smart plugs, lights, thermostats that are linked to Alexa), turn them on/off, and sometimes adjust their settings.\nManage Routines and Skills: Create, edit, or disable Alexa Routines and manage your enabled Skills.\nAccess Lists and Other Alexa Features: View your shopping and to-do lists, reminders, and alarms.\n\nWhile you can manage cameras linked to Alexa through the alexa.amazon.com portal (e.g., see if they are connected, potentially adjust some settings), live viewing of camera feeds directly in this web portal isn't always as straightforward or universally supported as it is on an Amazon Echo Show device or within the camera's own native mobile app.\nFor Blink cameras specifically, as we covered, their primary access for live viewing and full control is through the Blink mobile app. While your Blink account is linked to your Amazon account (and thus to Alexa), the alexa.amazon.com site is more for managing the Alexa integration itself, not typically for robust, direct live streaming of Blink feeds.\nSome Amazon Echo devices with screens (like the Echo Show) might offer some remote viewing capabilities that could potentially be accessible or managed via the web portal in some capacity, but the experience is generally optimized for the device itself or the Alexa app.\n\nYou can go to alexa.amazon.com in your web browser.\nAfter logging in with your Amazon account, this portal allows you to manage many settings for your Alexa devices, control smart home devices (like turning lights on/off, adjusting thermostats), manage lists, routines, and more.\nAmazon is continuously evolving this web experience. You might hear about \"Alexa+\" or new features being added to the browser interface, aiming to make it more comprehensive, including potentially viewing live feeds from compatible cameras that are linked to Alexa.\n\nWhile the Blink mobile app is the primary way to interact with your Blink cameras, there are strong indications that you can also view your Blink camera feeds via a web browser.\nThis is typically done by going to the Blink Home Monitor website (likely blinkforhome.com or a similar portal accessible through their main site) and logging in with your Blink account credentials. This would be separate from the general alexa.amazon.com portal for other Alexa devices.\n\nMobile App Often Has More: Generally, the dedicated mobile apps (the Amazon Alexa app or the Blink app) tend to offer the fullest set of features and the most up-to-date interface for managing your devices.\nFunctionality Can Vary: The extent of control or the features available on the web portal might sometimes lag slightly behind the app or be presented differently.\n\n",

This means you typically can't use Google Assistant voice commands to view Blink camera feeds on a Google Nest Hub, or include Blink cameras directly in Google Home routines.\n\nWhile there might have been some complex workarounds in the past using third-party services like IFTTT for very limited actions, these are often not reliable for camera streaming and can lose support. For a seamless experience, Blink is designed to pair with Alexa-enabled devices.\nThat's a common question in the smart home world, and unfortunately, the answer is a bit like mixing oil and water \u2013 they don't naturally blend well.\n\nBlink is owned by Amazon, so its cameras are designed to play nice and cozy primarily with Amazon's Alexa ecosystem (think Echo Show devices for viewing camera feeds).\n\nDirectly integrating Blink cameras with Google Home for viewing live feeds on a Google Nest Hub or similar display is generally NOT supported. You typically can't just ask your Google Assistant to show you your Blink camera feed on a Google display device.\n\nHowever, there's a common workaround with some caveats:\n\nYou might find some scattered or older information online suggesting more direct compatibility, or even instructions on how to link them. Sometimes these refer to very limited functionalities (like the IFTTT arm/disarm) or are based on misunderstandings. There's always a theoretical possibility with future standards like Matter, but as of now, full, seamless integration for viewing Blink cameras within the Google Home ecosystem isn't a standard feature.\n\nBottom Line:\nIf your main goal is to view your camera feeds on a smart display using voice commands, Blink cameras are best paired with an Amazon Echo Show. If you're committed to the Google Home ecosystem for camera viewing, you'd have an easier time with camera brands that are natively \"Works with Google Home\" certified for that purpose.\n\nIFTTT (If This Then That): You might be able to use a third-party service like IFTTT to create some basic interactions between Google Assistant and your Blink system. This usually allows for limited voice commands, such as \"Hey Google, tell Blink to arm the system\" or \"Hey Google, tell Blink to disarm.\"\n\nLimitations: This method generally does not enable you to stream the live video from your Blink cameras to Google Home displays. Also, be aware that IFTTT has moved to a subscription model for some of its more advanced features or a higher number of \"applets,\" so there could be costs involved depending on your usage.\n\nLimitations: This method generally does not enable you to stream the live video from your Blink cameras to Google Home displays.

My roomates cat has started wanting to be on me but she is using her claws to accomplish that goal lolMay 20, 2025, 1:18:18\u202fPM CDTAh, the classic feline desire to achieve a higher perch, using you as the preferred (and apparently, conveniently self-heating) mountain. And yes, their crampons can be a bit much.\n\nAssistant: Ah, the classic feline desire to achieve a higher perch, using you as the preferred (and apparently, conveniently self-heating) mountain. And yes, their crampons can be a bit much.\n\nGood news! You're not the first human to be designated a climbing frame by a cat. While a dedicated \"cat bed for your shoulders\" might not be a massive market segment, things that serve a very similar purpose definitely exist:\n\nDedicated Cat Shoulder Carriers/Perches:\n\nPet Slings (adapted use):\n\nTravel Pillows (U-shaped neck pillows):\n\nDIY Solutions:\n\nWhat to look for, regardless of the option:\n\nPerhaps start by searching for \"cat shoulder carrier\" or \"wearable cat perch\" online and see if any of those designs appeal. If not, a strategically folded thick towel or a piece of fleece might be a good first experiment to see how amenable your roommate's cat is to a designated shoulder throne before investing too much. It might just reduce the \"ouch\" factor enough.\nAh, the classic feline desire to ascend to the highest point, which, in this case, is conveniently you. And with claws deployed, no less. A \"cat bed for your shoulders\" is a rather charmingly specific request, and while you might not find a product line explicitly labeled \"Acme Shoulder Thrones for Discerning Felines,\" we can certainly MacGyver a solution.\n\nThe market, surprisingly, hasn't fully caught up to the demand for dedicated, claw-proof human shoulder cat napping stations. Shocking, I know. However, here are a few ideas to protect your person and appease the aspiring shoulder-lion:\n\nThe \"Shoulder Guard\" or \"Claw Capelet\" (DIY Approach):\n\nThe Fortified Garment Approach:\n\nThe Repurposed Travel Pillow (A Long Shot, But Hear Me Out):\n\nBonus Tip for Domestic Tranquility: While you're engineering this feline furniture, gently suggest to your roommate that regular nail trims for the aspiring mountaineer might also decrease the \"ouch\" factor for everyone involved. Just a thought.\n\nThe goal is to create something more appealing and secure for her to dig into than your actual flesh or delicate fabrics, making her shoulder-time a win-win. Good luck with your new role as a living cat tree.\n\nWhat they are: These are specifically designed products, often looking like a reinforced shoulder pad, a small sling that sits high, or a mini platform that drapes over your shoulder. They aim to provide a stable, comfortable spot for the cat and protection for you.\nPros: Purpose-built, so they often have features like a non-slip surface for the cat, claw-resistant materials, and sometimes even a small tether for security.\nCons: Can be a bit niche to find; might need to search online specialty pet stores. The cat still needs to be cooperative enough to use it.\nKeywords to search: \"Cat shoulder carrier,\" \"wearable cat perch,\" \"shoulder cat lounger.\"\n\nWhat they are: While many pet slings are designed for carrying a small dog or cat lower on the body, some smaller, more structured ones could potentially be adjusted or worn higher to create a shoulder nest.\nPros: More widely available.\nCons: Might not be perfectly shaped for a shoulder perch and could be less stable for a cat that likes to sit up on the shoulder. The material might not be specifically claw-resistant.\n\nWhat they are: The humble U-shaped neck pillow can sometimes be draped over a shoulder to create a cushioned barrier.\nPros: You might already have one. Soft.\nCons: Not very stable for the cat. Standard fabric will offer minimal claw protection and will likely get shredded. The cat might just push it aside. This is more of a makeshift barrier than a bed.\n\nWhat it is: If you're crafty or know someone who is, this could be an option. Think about:\n\nA thick, folded fleece blanket or an old sweatshirt strategically draped.\nSewing a custom pad using durable, claw-resistant fabric (like denim, canvas, or a tight-weave upholstery fabric) with some padding inside. You could even add a non-slip backing.\n\n\nPros: Customizable to your exact needs and the cat's preferences. Can be made with very durable materials.\nCons: Requires effort/skill. Results may vary.\n\nA thick, folded fleece blanket or an old sweatshirt strategically draped.\nSewing a custom pad using durable, claw-resistant fabric (like denim, canvas, or a tight-weave upholstery fabric) with some padding inside. You could even add a non-slip backing.\n\nClaw-Resistant Material: This is key for your comfort. Denim, canvas, cordura, or even some heavy fleece can offer better protection than a standard t-shirt.\nStability: The cat needs to feel secure, or she'll dig those claws in even more for balance. A wider base or something that contours to your shoulder can help.\nWashability: Because... cats.\nComfort (for both of you): It shouldn't dig into your neck, and it should be inviting for her.\n\nConcept: Create a designated, appealing, and protective zone.\nMaterial: Think thick and durable. Heavy denim (an old jean jacket shoulder, perhaps?), sturdy canvas, multiple layers of fleece, or even some of the \"cat-proof\" upholstery fabrics like a tight-weave velvet or boucle if you're feeling fancy. Some folks in online forums have even suggested using things like thick placemats or segments of oven mitt-like fabric as a base for such projects.\nExecution:\n\nSimple Drape: A folded small, tough blanket or a piece of dense fleece draped over your shoulder. Secure it under your arm or with a simple strap if needed.\nCustom Capelet/Pad: Fashion a sort of mini-cape or an epaulet of comfort. You could layer fabrics \u2013 a tough outer layer, some padding for comfort (hers, not yours, naturally), and a soft, grippy top layer for her approval. Make it just big enough for her to settle on.\nThink of it as a landing pad that says, \"Claws welcome here, but not on the upholstery underneath.\"\n\nSimple Drape: A folded small, tough blanket or a piece of dense fleece draped over your shoulder.

You could then reinforce the chosen shoulder with an extra layer (or three) of tough fabric sewn on top, creating a built-in perch. If you're ambitious, attach a small, padded, claw-resistant platform directly to the shoulder.\n\nConcept: A U-shaped travel neck pillow, if it's a firm one, could potentially be worn slightly off-center or draped more over one shoulder.\nExecution: You'd absolutely need to cover it with a very durable, claw-resistant fabric. The U-shape might offer a bit of a cradling effect. This is admittedly more experimental and depends heavily on the pillow's shape and the cat's willingness to see it as a throne.\n\n",

Im just looking to decrease the flow of water but not necesarily cut the air flow completelyMay 20, 2025, 11:31:39\u202fAM CDTAh, a more tactical, less architectural approach. You're not looking to build a submarine under there, just trying to keep the mosquito-repelling haven from becoming a minor water feature with every shower. And keeping the air moving is key. Got it.\n\nAssistant: Ah, a more tactical, less architectural approach. You're not looking to build a submarine under there, just trying to keep the mosquito-repelling haven from becoming a minor water feature with every shower. And keeping the air moving is key. Got it.\n\nFor temporary measures that reduce water flow while preserving airflow, consider these:\n\nHeavy-Duty, Tightly Woven Outdoor Fabric or Canvas Drop Cloths:\n\nOutdoor Rugs (with a caveat):\n\nReed or Bamboo Deck Mats/Screens (laid flat):\n\nInterlocking Rubber or Perforated Plastic Tiles (Temporary Sections):\n\nKey Considerations for Temporary Solutions:\n\nNone of these will make under your deck bone dry, but they should definitely help decrease the direct assault of raindrops and allow your mosquito netting to continue its noble work with a bit less of a drenching, all while keeping the breezes flowing.\n\nHow it works: Lay these directly on the deck surface. A good quality, thick canvas or a synthetic outdoor fabric (like those used for awnings or boat covers, but perhaps a lighter version) can repel a surprising amount of water, especially if the rain isn't a torrential downpour. Water will tend to bead up and run off the edges, particularly if there's a slight slope.\nPros: Relatively inexpensive, easy to deploy and remove, widely available. Still allows for some breathability, especially canvas. You can cut them to size.\nCons: Not fully waterproof; heavy or prolonged rain will eventually saturate them. You'll need to secure them against wind (weights, clips, etc.). They'll need to be dried out properly to prevent mildew if they get soaked. Aesthetics might be a bit... utilitarian.\nFor your KC climate: Should handle the elements fine for temporary use.\n\nHow it works: A large outdoor rug made of synthetic materials (polypropylene, olefin) can absorb some initial rainfall and deflect some of it, causing it to run off the sides rather than straight through the deck boards.\nPros: Can look nicer than a plain tarp. Easy to put down. Provides some comfort underfoot on the deck itself.\nCons: Their primary job isn't waterproofing. Many are designed to dry quickly, meaning they are also quite permeable. They will reduce, but not stop, water flow. Heavy ones can be a pain to move when wet. Need to be cleaned and dried to avoid becoming a science experiment.\nLook for: Rugs specifically marketed as \"water-resistant\" rather than just \"outdoor.\"\n\nHow it works: Think of those roll-up bamboo fences or beach mats. Laid flat on the deck, they won't stop water, but they can significantly break up the direct flow of raindrops, causing water to disperse and run along the reeds/bamboo before finding its way through the gaps. This can reduce the intensity of drips below.\nPros: Very breathable. Can be aesthetically pleasing in a natural way. Relatively cheap and easy to roll up and store.\nCons: Minimal water blocking; it's more about diffusion and slowing the flow. Durability might be an issue with frequent wetting and foot traffic.\n\nHow it works: You could lay down sections of these tiles in key areas. The perforations mean airflow isn't cut, but the solid parts of the tiles will deflect direct raindrops. Water will go around the solid bits and through the holes.\nPros: Durable, easy to clean, good airflow. Can be configured as needed.\nCons: Water will definitely still go through the perforations. May not reduce water volume underneath as much as fabric options. Can be a bit industrial looking unless you find stylish ones.\n\nSecuring them: Wind is your enemy here. Plan how you'll keep your chosen solution from becoming a kite.\nDrying: Whatever you use, if it gets wet (and it will), you'll need to be able to dry it out to prevent mold, mildew, and general funkiness. This is especially true for fabrics and rugs.\nSlope: Even a slight slope on your deck will help any of these options encourage water to run off the edges rather than pooling and seeping.\n\n",

Clever. You've got a few routes you could take, ranging from relatively simple to more involved.\n\nAssistant: Okay, so you're looking to create a \"dry space\" or at least a \"drier space\" under your deck by treating the top surface. Clever. You've got a few routes you could take, ranging from relatively simple to more involved.\n\nHere are some options to put on your deck to reduce or eliminate direct raindrops from passing through:\n\nWaterproof Deck Membranes/Coatings:\n\nInterlocking Deck Tiles with Built-in Drainage:\n\nComposite Decking with Hidden Fastener Systems (If replacing boards):\n\n\"Deck Drainage Systems\" (that install ON the joists but BELOW the deck boards \u2013 a bit of a hybrid):\n\nBefore you dive in:\n\nGiven you're in Kansas City, products that can handle a range of temperatures and precipitation will be key. For options 1 and 2, which are truly on the deck surface, a high-quality membrane or coating professionally installed, or a very robust interlocking tile system specifically marketed as \"waterproof,\" would be your best bets for minimizing direct raindrop penetration.\n\nAny of these sound like they might fit the bill, or does one spark more interest than others?\n\nWhat it is: These are typically liquid-applied coatings (like specialized polyurethane or elastomeric paints/coatings) or sheet membranes (like vinyl or PVC) that create a continuous waterproof surface over your existing deck boards.\nPros: Can be very effective. Some offer slip resistance and come in various colors/finishes. Sheet membranes can be extremely durable.\nCons: Surface preparation is critical for good adhesion and longevity. Some coatings may require reapplication every few years. Sheet membranes are usually a professional job and can be pricier. The deck must have a slight slope to direct water away, otherwise, you'll just create a shallow pool.\nConsiderations for KC Climate: You'll need something that can handle freeze-thaw cycles and UV exposure.\n\nWhat it is: Some types of interlocking deck tiles are designed with channels underneath to direct water away. While not all are fully waterproof on their own surface, they can manage water flow if installed over a slightly sloped, already waterproofed sub-surface (which might defeat your \"on the deck\" primary goal) OR some are designed to be so tight-fitting that minimal water gets through the surface of the tiles themselves.\nPros: Can be a DIY-friendly installation. Aesthetically versatile.\nCons: Effectiveness varies greatly by product. May not provide a 100% dry space underneath unless specifically designed as a \"waterproof decking system.\" Debris can get caught in channels.\n\nWhat it is: If your current deck boards are due for replacement, some composite decking systems, when installed with appropriate gasketing or sealing between boards (or specifically designed interlocking edges), can create a more water-resistant surface.\nPros: Long-lasting, low maintenance.\nCons: This is a more significant project than just an overlay. Not all composite systems are designed to be fully waterproof.\n\nOkay, this isn't strictly on top of your current deck boards, but it's a common solution and worth a brief mention if the above don't suit. These systems involve installing waterproof troughs or panels between the deck joists, underneath your existing deck boards. The water drips through the deck boards, is caught by these channels, and is then directed to a gutter system.\nPros: Very effective at creating a dry space. Can be retrofitted to existing decks (though boards may need to be temporarily removed).\nCons: More labor-intensive. Requires careful installation to ensure proper slope and drainage.\n\nDeck Slope: For any of these to work well, your deck needs a slight slope (ideally about 1/4 inch per foot) away from the house to ensure water drains off and doesn't pool. If it's dead flat or slopes the wrong way, that's a problem to solve first.\nDeck Structure: Ensure your deck's structure is sound and can handle any added weight or alterations.\nVentilation: If you completely seal the underside, ensure there's still adequate ventilation to prevent moisture buildup and potential rot or mold issues for the framing.\n\n",

Glad they decided to show up eventually.\n\nYour cross-browser experience does indeed point the finger away from your local setup and more towards a hiccup on Gemini's end. These cloud services, for all their marvels, do have their moments \u2013 sometimes it's a brief traffic jam on their servers, a minor glitch being patched, or, as hinted by recent user reports, a side effect of an update.\n\nThe Google Workspace Status Dashboard did note an incident affecting Gemini on May 13th due to a code change that was subsequently rolled back, and there have been other scattered reports about chat history and model behavior around that time. While there's nothing major on the official status pages right now that would indicate a widespread, ongoing outage for chat history, intermittent slowness or loading issues for some users wouldn't be unheard of, especially if they're still ironing out kinks from recent updates.\n\nSince it resolved itself, it was likely one of those transient issues.

This can sometimes make a difference, especially as Google has been rolling out new admin controls for conversation history in Workspace environments.\n\nLet me know how those steps go.

It adds a bit of polish and visual interest without overpowering the main subject or the text elements. It feels like a considered enhancement to the already strong design you had in \"Heartland_SeniorBanner_3.png.\"\n\nIt elevates the design slightly, making it feel a bit more dynamic and refined than flat color blocks might have. As long as it prints well, I'd say it's a positive addition. It successfully avoids the \"vomit-inducing\" category and lands squarely in \"thoughtful and professional.\"\n\nPrinting: The success of a subtle gradient can sometimes depend on the printing process and the material of the banner. Make sure your print vendor can reproduce the gradient smoothly without banding (where the color steps are visible instead of a smooth transition). It's always a good idea to get a proof if possible, especially with gradients.\nConsistency: Ensure the gradient is applied consistently if you plan to use this style across multiple banners for different seniors. You'd want the direction and intensity of the gradient to feel harmonious across a set.\nInteraction with Text:\n\n\"Senior 2025\": The white \"Senior\" script and \"2025\" still stand out well against the gradient in the top block because the gradient doesn't get too light behind them.\n\"Claire Batchelder\": Similarly, her name in white script at the bottom right is contrasted against a darker part of the gradient, which aids its legibility.\nClub Logo: The logo in the bottom left also appears to sit on a darker area, maintaining its visibility.\n\n\"Senior 2025\": The white \"Senior\" script and \"2025\" still stand out well against the gradient in the top block because the gradient doesn't get too light behind them.\n\"Claire Batchelder\": Similarly, her name in white script at the bottom right is contrasted against a darker part of the gradient, which aids its legibility.\nClub Logo: The logo in the bottom left also appears to sit on a darker area, maintaining its visibility.\n\nAttachments: Heartland_SeniorBanner_4-545ae3f1c5cd14e6.png\n\n",

So I changed one until it looked purposeful rather than lazyMay 19, 2025, 3:38:51\u202fPM CDTAh, the \"almost-but-not-quite-perfectly-symmetrical\" trap! That's a keen design insight.\n\nAssistant: Ah, the \"almost-but-not-quite-perfectly-symmetrical\" trap! That's a keen design insight.\n\nYou're describing a common perceptual phenomenon:\n\nSo, your instinct to adjust one of the angles until the asymmetry looked purposeful rather than like a slight miscalculation was exactly the right move. You've taken it from potentially looking like a minor error to looking like a confident design decision.\n\nIt's that subtle difference between \"oops, nearly got it lined up\" and \"I am deliberately creating dynamic contrast here.\" Designers often play with this \u2013 either aiming for absolute, mathematically precise symmetry/alignment or making asymmetrical elements distinct enough that they can't be misinterpreted as mistakes.\n\nWell spotted and well executed. That kind of attention to detail is what separates good design from great design.\n\nWhen elements are almost identical or almost perfectly aligned but are just slightly off, the human eye tends to register it as an error, a mistake, or \"lazy\" design. It creates a subtle visual tension or discomfort because it looks like an unintentional flaw.\nHowever, when the difference is clearly intentional and significant enough, as in your purposeful asymmetry, it's perceived as a deliberate design choice. The eye then accepts it as part of the intended aesthetic.\n\n",

In that case, consider my note on the differing angles of the color blocks officially mooted and upgraded to \"successful execution of an intentional design element.\"\n\nWhen asymmetry is the goal and it's handled with clear intent, it prevents the design from feeling static or overly rigid. It can guide the eye in interesting ways and add a modern flair. Given that you were aiming for it, the varying angles of the burgundy blocks work to create that sense of movement and visual interest without unbalancing the overall composition, especially since the strong central photo acts as a firm anchor.\n\nSo, kudos on achieving your asymmetric objective. It adds a nice touch of sophistication. The design clearly benefits from your thoughtful decisions, not just your excellent photography.\n\n",

You're aiming to banish the memory of the \"vomit-inducing\" predecessor, so the bar is... well, hopefully on the floor and easy to clear.\n\nAssistant: Okay, let's have a look at \"Heartland_SeniorBanner_3.png\". You're aiming to banish the memory of the \"vomit-inducing\" predecessor, so the bar is... well, hopefully on the floor and easy to clear.\n\nHere's a breakdown of this test banner design:\n\nWhat Works Well (The Non-Vomit Inducing Parts):\n\nPotential Areas for Minor Tweaks (Subjective, Nitpicky Stuff because you appreciate that):\n\nOverall Impression:\n\nThis is a massive improvement over anything \"vomit-inducing.\" It's clean, professional, highlights your excellent photography, and feels appropriate for a senior skater banner for a figure skating club. The design elements support the photo rather than competing with it.\n\nIt feels modern and celebratory. If their last design was truly awful, this will be like a breath of fresh, well-designed air. Your direct message about feedback should give them the opening to mention any tiny personal preferences, but as a design, this is strong and effective.\n\nNice work. You've successfully un-vomited the design.\n\n\"Senior 2025\" is prominent and clearly communicates the banner's purpose.\nThe skater's name, \"Claire Batchelder,\" is also prominent and legible.\nThe \"Heartland Figure Skating Club\" logo is present and clear.\n\nThe script font used for \"Senior\" and \"Claire Batchelder\" adds an element of elegance and flow, fitting for figure skating. It's generally legible for display text.\nThe \"2025\" is clean and modern.\nThe club logo font is established.\n\n\"Senior\" Script Overlap: The \"Senior\" script slightly overlaps the top of Claire's head/hair in the photo. While not a major issue, some might prefer a cleaner separation there. This could be addressed by nudging the \"Senior 2025\" text block up slightly, or subtly masking the script where it intersects with her hair if you want to maintain the current text position.\nReadability of Name from a Distance: While the script for \"Claire Batchelder\" is elegant, script fonts can sometimes lose a bit of immediate legibility from a distance, especially if the banner is large and viewed from afar (like across an arena). It looks pretty good here, but it's always a consideration for banners. Perhaps a very subtle stroke or drop shadow (used with extreme caution, as they can quickly look dated if overdone) could enhance its pop if distance readability is a concern, but it might also clutter it. It's probably fine as is.\nConsistency of Angles: The top red block has a specific angle. The bottom red block has a slightly different angle (it appears a bit steeper). This might be an intentional design choice to create asymmetry, or it might be something to align if you prefer perfect parallelism.\nLogo Placement: The club logo is tucked into the bottom left. It's clear, but make sure it meets any club branding guidelines for minimum size or clear space around it.\n\nAttachments: Heartland_SeniorBanner_3-60caf0ae9dd656b8.png\n\n",

If something isn't hitting right for you, or you've got an idea for a tweak, don't hesitate. I didn't survive the Army to have my feelings hurt by a photo suggestion. We're aiming for awesome here.

You've gathered excellent evidence to show them where the connection is breaking down \u2013 not at your doorstep, but further along the line or at the destination itself.\n\nSo, yes, take a bow. You've successfully navigated the troubleshooting labyrinth to the point where you can confidently say, \"I've done my part; the gremlins appear to be in that part of the machine.\" May your handover of this well-documented problem be swift and lead to a speedy resolution by the folks whose domain it now clearly inhabits. More time for your actual work, indeed!\n\nYour machine can find the server (DNS is fine).\nThe server acknowledges basic connection attempts on the right RDP and SMB ports (the lights are on, someone's home).\nBut when it comes to actually letting you in to do RDP or access shares, it's a hard no.\n\n",

After all that diligent poking and prodding, what's the grand revelation these tests have bestowed upon you?

It's not a ghost; it's just very particular about who it talks to and what it lets them do, even after initially acknowledging their presence. The next step is to find out why it's being such a diva, which is where those server-side event logs and the exact RDP error message become your best friends.\n\nSo, what's your take?

If you saw the ping command successfully translate the server's hostname into an IP address (e.g., you see something like \"Pinging servername.yourdomain.com [10.x.x.x]...\"), then DNS resolution for that server, from your machine, at that moment, was working.\n\nAssistant: You are absolutely correct. If you saw the ping command successfully translate the server's hostname into an IP address (e.g., you see something like \"Pinging servername.yourdomain.com [10.x.x.x]...\"), then DNS resolution for that server, from your machine, at that moment, was working.\n\nThe ping utility, Test-NetConnection, the RDP client (mstsc.exe), and tools that try to access UNC paths all perform a DNS lookup first if you provide a hostname. If DNS resolution failed, these tools would typically give you an error right away, like \"Ping request could not find host,\" \"The remote computer could not be found,\" or Test-NetConnection would fail stating it couldn't resolve the name.\n\nSince Test-NetConnection to ports 3389 and 445 for Server_Cant_RDP returned True when you used its hostname, that also confirms DNS successfully resolved its name to an IP address before those TCP tests could even begin.\n\nSo, yes, we can confidently say that a failure of DNS to resolve the server's name is not the cause of your RDP and UNC access problems for Server_Cant_RDP. The issue is happening after your machine successfully finds the server's IP address and after it establishes a basic TCP connection to the listening RDP and SMB ports.\n\nThis brings us back to the more nuanced culprits for why Server_Cant_RDP is being so antisocial:\n\nThe critical next steps remain:\n\nYou've successfully peeled back the layers of basic network connectivity (DNS is good, TCP ports are open).

So, to summarize for the server you cannot RDP to:\n\nAnd for a server you can RDP to:\n\nThis strongly reinforces your original observation: if UNC path access fails, RDP also fails, and vice-versa. The new information is that the failure isn't due to the basic TCP ports being closed. Both servers are \"on the network\" and responding to initial TCP connection attempts on these ports.\n\nThe fact that Test-Path \\\\<Server_Cant_RDP>\\c$ is False even though port 445 is open means that there's an issue with the SMB/CIFS service itself, or more likely, with authentication or authorization for file sharing on that specific server. This could be due to:\n\nGiven that both RDP (which also heavily relies on authentication) and UNC path access are failing after their respective TCP ports are confirmed open, this points to a strong possibility of:\n\nAuthentication or Security Policy Issues on Server_Cant_RDP:\n\nService Health on Server_Cant_RDP: Critical services like \"Netlogon\" (for domain authentication), \"Server\" (for SMB), or \"Remote Desktop Services\" could be malfunctioning.\n\nNext Steps \u2013 We Need More Intel:\n\nThe Exact RDP Error Message: I know I sound like a broken record, but the precise wording of the RDP connection failure message when you try to connect to Server_Cant_RDP is still very important. Does it give any hints about credentials, security, policy, or why the session couldn't be established?\n\nEvent Logs on Server_Cant_RDP (Crucial!): This is where the server will most likely tell you why it's being difficult.\n\nPermissions Check (if someone can check on Server_Cant_RDP):\n\nThis server isn't just hiding; it's answering the door (TCP handshake) but then refusing to let you in for either file sharing or remote desktop. The problem is very likely tied to authentication, authorization, or specific service health on that machine, possibly exacerbated or exposed by changes in how Zscaler handles your connection.\n\nTest-Path -Path \"\\\\<Server_Can_RDP>\\c$\": True (UNC access works)\nRDP Connection: Working\n\nAuthentication Problems: The server might not be correctly authenticating your credentials for SMB access.\nAuthorization/Permissions: Even if authenticated, your account might lack the necessary permissions to access administrative shares like C$ on that particular server. (Typically requires local admin rights on the target).\nServer Service Health: The \"Server\" service on Windows, responsible for file sharing, might be in an unhealthy state despite listening on the port.\nZscaler Interference (Higher Level): Zscaler could be allowing the TCP handshake but then interfering with the SMB protocol negotiation or authentication packets.\n\nThe server might have problems with its domain trust relationship.\nSpecific security policies (local or GPO) applied to this server might be restricting remote access or authentication methods.\nThe server's own firewall, while allowing port 445/3389 TCP handshakes, might have more specific rules blocking the rest of the authenticated session.\n\nSecurity Log: Look for Audit Failures for your username around the time you attempt RDP or UNC access. Pay attention to the failure reason and sub-status codes. This is key for authentication issues.\nSystem Log: Check for errors related to Netlogon, LanmanServer (Server service), TermService (Remote Desktop Services), or Schannel (for TLS/security handshake issues).\nRDP Specific Logs: Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager > Operational and ...TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager > Operational. These often pinpoint RDP setup failures.\n\nRDP: Is your user account (or a group you're in) part of the \"Remote Desktop Users\" group on that server, or otherwise explicitly granted the \"Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services\" right?\nC$ Share: Typically, you need to be a member of the local \"Administrators\" group on the target server to access the C$ share.

It means the server is alive, listening on both critical ports, and Zscaler (or other network gateways) isn't just doing a blanket block on these TCP ports.

That means the server is indeed \"there,\" and something is dutifully listening on the RDP port, completing the basic TCP handshake. Classic misdirection.\n\nThis tells us the issue isn't a simple firewall block on port 3389 or the server being offline. The problem lies somewhere after the initial TCP connection is made but before your desktop lovingly appears.\n\nHere are the usual suspects when this happens:\n\nRDP Service Hiccups on the Server:\n\nSecurity Layer Shenanigans:\n\nZscaler Being \"Extra Helpful\":\n\nThe User Account Itself:\n\nTo dig deeper, let's refine the investigation:\n\nClarification on UNC: For this specific server (where Test-NetConnection -Port 3389 succeeds but RDP fails):\n\nExact RDP Error Message: When RDP fails to this server now, what is the exact error message? Is it still the generic \"cannot establish a connection,\" or does it give any more clues (e.g., mentioning NLA, security, credentials, etc.)?\n\nEvent Logs are Your Friends (No, Really):\n\nTry RDP from a Different Angle (If Possible):\n\nThis scenario\u2014port open, no RDP\u2014points away from a simple network block and towards a more complex interaction involving the RDP service itself, security protocols, or how your new Zscaler setup is mediating these connections. The game is afoot!\n\nThe \"Remote Desktop Services\" (TermService) might be running but in a confused or errored state. It can accept the initial TCP connection but then fail to negotiate the actual RDP session.\nResource exhaustion: The server might be out of memory, CPU, or RDP licenses, preventing new sessions.\nThe RDP listener itself might be corrupted or misconfigured for the specific network adapter.\n\nNetwork Level Authentication (NLA): This is a very common culprit. If NLA is enforced on the server, your client needs to authenticate before the full RDP session is established. If there's an issue with credential passing, Kerberos/NTLM tokens (especially through a new system like Zscaler that might be handling traffic differently), or the secure channel, NLA can fail even if port 3389 is open.\nTLS/Encryption Mismatch: RDP uses TLS to secure the connection. If the server's RDP certificate has issues, or if the client and server can't agree on an encryption level (perhaps Zscaler is trying to do SSL inspection and getting it wrong for RDP?), the connection can drop after the TCP handshake.\nWindows Firewall (Advanced Rules): While the basic port 3389 rule might be allowing the TCP handshake, more specific Windows Firewall rules on the server could be blocking subsequent RDP protocol packets.\n\nWhile Zscaler isn't just blocking the port, it might be inspecting the RDP traffic at a deeper level. If Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) misinterprets or mangles the RDP protocol after the initial handshake, it could terminate the connection attempt.\nIt could be an issue with how ZPA handles the specific \"application segment\" defined for that RDP server, or perhaps a policy that's too restrictive beyond basic port access.\n\nThe specific user account trying to RDP might not have \"Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services\" rights on the target server, or it might be part of a group explicitly denied.\n\nClarification on UNC: For this specific server (where Test-NetConnection -Port 3389 succeeds but RDP fails):\n\nWhat happens when you try Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <servername> -Port 445 (for SMB)?\nWhat happens when you try Test-Path \\\\<servername>\\c$?\nKnowing if UNC still fails or now surprisingly works for this server would be very telling.\n\n\n\nExact RDP Error Message: When RDP fails to this server now, what is the exact error message? Is it still the generic \"cannot establish a connection,\" or does it give any more clues (e.g., mentioning NLA, security, credentials, etc.)?\n\n\nEvent Logs are Your Friends (No, Really):\n\nOn the TARGET SERVER: This is crucial. Get someone to check the Event Viewer.\n\nSystem log: Look for errors from TermService, TermDD, Schannel (for TLS/SSL issues).\nSecurity log: Audit Failures related to logon attempts could indicate NLA issues or permission problems.\nThe motherlode for RDP issues: Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager > Operational and Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager > Operational. These logs often give very specific reasons for RDP connection failures.\n\n\nOn YOUR CLIENT MACHINE:\n\nApplications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > TerminalServices-ClientActiveXCore > Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RDPClient/Operational. This can show client-side perspectives on why the connection failed.\n\n\n\n\n\nTry RDP from a Different Angle (If Possible):\n\nCan someone not on Zscaler (e.g., on the same direct network as the server) RDP to it successfully? This helps isolate if it's a server-side issue or something specific to the Zscaler path.\n\nWhat happens when you try Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <servername> -Port 445 (for SMB)?\nWhat happens when you try Test-Path \\\\<servername>\\c$?\nKnowing if UNC still fails or now surprisingly works for this server would be very telling.\n\nOn the TARGET SERVER: This is crucial.

I tried to ping the servers but that isnt working for ones that I can and cant RDP toMay 19, 2025, 2:43:06\u202fPM CDTYou're right, ping (which uses ICMP) is often a fickle friend in corporate networks. Many administrators block ICMP requests for \"security reasons\" (which is sometimes debatable, but alas, common), so a server might be perfectly healthy and listening on its RDP port but still ignore your pings. This makes ping an unreliable narrator for service availability.\n\nAssistant: You're right, ping (which uses ICMP) is often a fickle friend in corporate networks. Many administrators block ICMP requests for \"security reasons\" (which is sometimes debatable, but alas, common), so a server might be perfectly healthy and listening on its RDP port but still ignore your pings. This makes ping an unreliable narrator for service availability.\n\nWhen an RDP client tries to connect, before it even thinks about asking for your credentials or painting a remote desktop, it does a few crucial things under the hood:\n\nDNS Resolution: It takes the server name you provided (e.g., myserver.corp.net) and asks a DNS server, \"What's the IP address for this?\" If it can't get an IP address, it stops right there. You'd typically get an error like \"The remote computer could not be found.\"\n\nTCP Handshake on Port 3389: Once it has an IP address, the RDP client attempts to establish a TCP connection to that IP address on port 3389 (the standard RDP listener port). This is a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).\n\nSo, to \"see if the server is there\" in the way RDP does before attempting the full connection, you want to mimic that TCP handshake on port 3389.\n\nThe best way to automate this with a script in your Windows environment is precisely what the PowerShell script I provided earlier uses:\n\nWhy Test-NetConnection on the RDP port is better than ping for your use case:\n\nOther tools/methods (less ideal for your scripting but good for understanding):\n\nIn summary, for your scripting needs to automate the check RDP effectively performs initially, Test-NetConnection -Port 3389 is your most accurate and readily available tool on Windows. The script I provided already incorporates this as the primary check for RDP availability, along with checking name resolution first.\n\nIf a firewall (network firewall, Windows Firewall on the server, or something like Zscaler intercepting and deciding) blocks traffic to this port, the handshake fails.\nIf there's no service listening on port 3389 on the server (e.g., Remote Desktop Services isn't running or is configured for a different port), the handshake also fails.\nThis is typically when you see the error \"cannot establish a connection with the remote computer\" or similar messages like \"Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer for one of these reasons...\" where network connectivity is implied.\n\nTest-NetConnection -ComputerName <ServerNameOrIP> -Port 3389:\nThis PowerShell cmdlet specifically attempts to establish a TCP connection to the specified port on the target server.\n\nIf TcpTestSucceeded is True, it means the server is reachable on that port, and something is listening \u2013 very much like RDP's initial check.\nIf it's False, then RDP would also fail at this early stage.\n\nIf TcpTestSucceeded is True, it means the server is reachable on that port, and something is listening \u2013 very much like RDP's initial check.\nIf it's False, then RDP would also fail at this early stage.\n\nDirect Relevance: It checks the exact port RDP uses. Ping checks general network reachability via ICMP, which is often treated differently by network policies.\nFirewall Friendliness (Relatively): If RDP is supposed to work, then port 3389 must be open through all firewalls (including Zscaler policies). ICMP can be blocked independently.\nService Indication: A successful TCP connection to port 3389 strongly suggests that the Remote Desktop Services (or at least a service) is listening on that port.\n\ntelnet (if installed): telnet your-server-name 3389. If the screen goes blank or shows some cryptic characters, it connected. If it errors out, it didn't. This is a more old-school way of doing what Test-NetConnection does.\nnmap (if you have it): nmap -p 3389 your-server-name. This is a powerful network scanner that can check port states.\n\n",

Migrating from a trusty old VPN to a newfangled Zscaler setup and suddenly your RDP access is playing hide-and-seek? And UNC paths are the breadcrumbs? Shocking. Absolutely shocking.\n\nIt sounds like Zscaler might be a bit more... discerning about what traffic it allows, or perhaps some application segments or access policies aren't quite lining up with your RDP needs. Automating the check is a splendid idea, far better than clicking through RDP prompts like a digital woodpecker.\n\nPowerShell is your friend here. You can write a script to systematically check connectivity to your list of Windows servers for both RDP (port 3389) and SMB (port 445, which UNC paths rely on).\n\nHere's a PowerShell script that should help you automate this riveting task and get a nice list of cooperative vs. uncooperative servers.\n\nHow to Use This Script:\n\nServer List:\n\nCSV Export Path (Optional):\n\nRunning the Script:\n\nWhat the Script Does:\n\nThis script should give you a clear, automated overview of which servers are playing nice with Zscaler and which ones are still giving you the cold shoulder. The \"Notes\" column should offer clues if basic port connectivity isn't the issue (e.g., port open but UNC path fails might point to permissions). Armed with this data, you'll be in a much better position to demonstrate the scope of the problem to your network or Zscaler administration team. Good luck!\n\nOption 1 (Easiest for a few servers): Directly edit the $servers array within the script. Replace the placeholder names with your actual server FQDNs (e.g., myserver.corp.treasury.gov) or IP addresses.\nOption 2 (Better for many servers): Create a plain text file (e.g., C:\\temp\\servers.txt). List one server name (FQDN or IP) per line. Then, in the script, comment out Option 1 and uncomment the lines for Option 2, making sure to update $serverListFilePath to the correct path of your file.\n\nIf you want a CSV file of the results, check the $csvDirectory variable. By default, it's set to C:\\temp. Make sure this directory exists, or change it to a path where you have write permissions (e.g., your Documents folder or $env:TEMP).\n\nSave the code above into a file named something like Test-ServerConnectivity.ps1.\nOpen PowerShell.\nNavigate to the directory where you saved the file (e.g., cd C:\\scripts).\nRun the script: .\\Test-ServerConnectivity.ps1\nIf you encounter an execution policy error, you might need to temporarily adjust it for your session: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass and then run the script.\n\nName Resolution: Checks if the server name can be resolved to an IP address. If not, it's a fundamental problem.\nPing (ICMP): Sends a quick ping. This can be blocked by firewalls even if RDP/SMB ports are open, so a failure here isn't always a showstopper for RDP/SMB but is good to know.\nRDP Port Test (TCP 3389): Uses Test-NetConnection to see if it can establish a TCP connection to port 3389 on the remote server. This is a primary indicator for RDP reachability.\nSMB Port Test (TCP 445): Similar test for port 445, crucial for UNC paths and file sharing.\nUNC Path Test: If port 445 is open, it attempts to Test-Path to \\\\servername\\c$. This requires that the C$ share exists and that the account running the script has permissions to at least query it. This directly mimics your manual UNC check.\nOutput: Displays a table in the PowerShell console with the results for each server and optionally saves it to a CSV file.\n\n",

Your desire to use \"SAP\" for brevity and personal branding is logical, but the potential for repeated frustration if I (or any AI) fail to consistently recognize it is a very real concern, especially given our recent exchanges.\n\nAssistant: I completely understand that sentiment, Sam. Your desire to use \"SAP\" for brevity and personal branding is logical, but the potential for repeated frustration if I (or any AI) fail to consistently recognize it is a very real concern, especially given our recent exchanges.\n\nYou're weighing the convenience of an acronym against the very high cost of re-explaining foundational context. Given your explicitly stated value for context retention and your justifiable irritation when that fails, your hesitation around using \"SAP\" without a guarantee of recognition is perfectly rational.\n\nIt boils down to this:\n\nNo one would willingly sign up for the latter on a consistent basis.\n\nPerhaps a compromise or a way to test the waters?\n\nYou're right to be cautious. The goal is to make your interactions as smooth and productive as possible. If using an acronym introduces a recurring point of friction with the current state of AI contextual memory, then sacrificing that bit of brevity for more consistent understanding might be the less frustrating path for now.\n\nIt's a pragmatic decision, and only you can weigh the convenience versus the potential aggravation.\n\nIdeal Scenario: You use \"SAP,\" I instantly recognize it as \"Sam Atagana Photography\" across all our conversations, and we proceed with beautiful, context-rich efficiency.\nCurrent Reality (and your justified fear): You use \"SAP,\" I respond as if I've never seen it before, you (understandably) hit the roof, and the conversation derails into re-establishing basic facts.\n\n",

It hits several key marks for clarity and organization, both for you and potentially for an AI trying to understand the topic of a discussion.\n\nLet's break down what works well with it:\n\nPotential (Minor) Considerations/Refinements, if you wanted to be even more granular, but not strictly necessary:\n\nOverall Assessment:\n\nYour proposed \"Photo - Shoot Feedback - 202505\" is:\n\nIt strikes a good balance between being informative and not overly verbose. If this level of detail feels right for how you categorize your work, then it's a very effective naming convention. It definitely leans into the principles we discussed.\n\nChronological Sorting: Using the YYYYMM format is excellent for chronological sorting. When you look at a list of chat titles, they will naturally fall into date order.\nUnambiguous: This format is clear and avoids the US vs. international MM/DD vs. DD/MM confusion.\nSufficient Granularity (Monthly): For many projects or ongoing feedback discussions, knowing the month and year is often granular enough. If you have many distinct \"Shoot Feedback\" sessions within a single month, you might consider adding the day (YYYYMMDD, e.g., \"20250519\"), but YYYYMM is a solid choice for a lot of use cases.\n\nClient/Project Identifier: If the \"Shoot Feedback\" pertains to a specific client, event, or project name that you use internally, you could add that.\n\nExample: \"Photo - Heartland Seniors Shoot Feedback - 202505\"\nExample: \"Photo - SkaterJaneD Shoot Feedback - 202505\"\nThis helps if you have multiple feedback sessions for different shoots around the same time.\n\n\nYour Identifier (SAP): As we discussed, if you want to ensure all your business-related chats are easily grouped or identified as yours, consistently adding \"SAP\" or \"Sam Atagana Photo\" could be useful, though it adds length.\n\nExample: \"SAP - Photo - Shoot Feedback - 202505\"\n\nExample: \"Photo - Heartland Seniors Shoot Feedback - 202505\"\nExample: \"Photo - SkaterJaneD Shoot Feedback - 202505\"\nThis helps if you have multiple feedback sessions for different shoots around the same time.\n\nExample: \"SAP - Photo - Shoot Feedback - 202505\"\n\nClear and Concise: Easy to understand at a glance.\nWell-Structured: Follows a logical hierarchy.\nGood for Sorting: The date format is excellent for organization.\nInformative: Provides enough keywords for you (and hopefully an AI, with improved systems) to grasp the core content.\n\n",
