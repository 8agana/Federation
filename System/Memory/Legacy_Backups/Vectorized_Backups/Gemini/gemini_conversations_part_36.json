Its JUST the SSL certApr 8, 2025, 1:20:04\u202fPM CDTOkay, if you're certain the DMGR's truststore hasn't changed, and only the DMGR's own SSL certificate was swapped out, that definitely makes the situation stranger and points away from the usual suspects. A server changing its own ID card (its SSL cert) shouldn't normally break its ability to validate your ID card (your PIV), assuming its list of trusted ID issuers (the truststore) is untouched.\n\nAssistant: Okay, if you're certain the DMGR's truststore hasn't changed, and only the DMGR's own SSL certificate was swapped out, that definitely makes the situation stranger and points away from the usual suspects. A server changing its own ID card (its SSL cert) shouldn't normally break its ability to validate your ID card (your PIV), assuming its list of trusted ID issuers (the truststore) is untouched.\n\nBut stranger things have happened in WebSphere. Let's consider less common possibilities:\n\nServer Cert Chain Issue / Browser Trust: Is it possible the new SSL certificate on the DMGR has issues? Maybe its full chain (intermediate CAs) isn't being presented correctly by WebSphere, or isn't trusted by your browser? If your browser has issues validating the server's new SSL certificate during the initial handshake, it might refuse to send your PIV certificate when prompted later.\n\nTLS Handshake Negotiation: Did the new SSL certificate perhaps necessitate or coincide with a change in supported TLS protocols (e.g., requiring TLS 1.3 now) or cipher suites on the DMGR? If the browser and server now negotiate a specific combination of protocol/cipher suite that has issues with client certificate handling in this WAS version, it could break.\n\nIncorrect Certificate Alias in Config: In WebSphere's SSL configuration, you specify which certificate alias from the keystore the server should use. If the new SSL certificate was imported with a different alias than the old one, but the SSL configuration wasn't updated to point to this new alias, the DMGR might be failing to load its own SSL certificate correctly, leading to handshake failures that manifest weirdly.\n\nWebSphere Quirks/Bugs: There might be a specific defect or obscure interaction in your version of WebSphere where replacing the default server certificate does somehow interfere with the client certificate logic, even if it logically shouldn't.\n\nAre We Absolutely Sure? Middleware changes can be finicky. Is it positive that no other related configuration (SSL settings, security properties, endpoint security configs) was tweaked, even accidentally, during the certificate swap? Sometimes scripts or automated processes touch more than intended.\n\nGiven these constraints, my strongest guesses shift towards #1 (Browser distrusting the new server cert chain) or #3 (Wrong alias in the SSL config), or potentially #2 (TLS parameter mismatch). The fact remains, the timing points directly to that DMGR cert change as the trigger. The team needs to meticulously review the entire SSL configuration associated with that DMGR endpoint (port 9043), not just the keystore and truststore files themselves, paying close attention to the certificate alias being used and the negotiated TLS parameters.\n\nCheck: Does your browser show any HTTPS warnings (e.g., padlock icon issues, \"Not Secure\" warnings) before you get the client certificate error?\n\n",

Apr 8, 2025, 1:18:42\u202fPM CDTOkay, that narrows it down considerably and points the finger squarely away from you and your PIV card.\n\nAssistant: Okay, that narrows it down considerably and points the finger squarely away from you and your PIV card.\n\nThis strongly suggests the problem lies with the DMGR's configuration, likely related to the certificate update process.\n\nHere\u2019s the most probable scenario:\n\nFor client certificate authentication to work, the server (DMGR) needs to trust the issuer of the client certificate (your PIV card). This trust is established via the server's truststore, which contains the public certificates of the Certificate Authorities (CAs) it deems trustworthy.\n\nWhen the certificate was updated on the DMGR, it's highly likely that:\n\nEssentially, the DMGR's bouncer got new instructions (the new cert/trust config), and those instructions no longer include recognizing the authority that backs your perfectly valid PIV ID.\n\nLess likely, but possible: The update might have also borked other specific SSL/TLS settings on the DMGR related to how it requests or validates client certificates on that admin port (9043).\n\nConclusion: This isn't a \"you\" problem anymore. It's almost certainly a server-side configuration issue stemming from the recent DMGR certificate update. The team that performed that update needs to verify that the DMGR's truststore is correctly configured to trust the PIV issuing CA(s) and that the SSL configuration for client authentication on the admin console endpoint is correct.\n\nYou can confidently tell whoever will listen: \"My PIV is fine. The issue started right after the DMGR cert update. Please check the DMGR's truststore and client authentication settings for the admin console.\"\n\nYou know your client cert (PIV).\nYour PIV cert hasn't changed.\nThe server (specifically the WebSphere Deployment Manager - DMGR) did have a certificate change.\n\n",

This isn't the server's SSL certificate (the one that makes HTTPS work); this is a client certificate. Think of it as a digital ID card issued specifically to you (or your workstation) by a trusted authority (likely an internal Treasury Certificate Authority - CA). The WebSphere console (was-op-a01.fiscalad.treasury.gov) is configured to demand this personal/workstation ID before it even lets you try a username and password, as an extra layer of security.\n\nSo, how do you figure out which specific digital ID card it wants?\n\nDoes exploring certmgr.msc or your browser's certificate list reveal any likely candidates, perhaps one issued by a Treasury-specific authority? Or maybe one that just recently expired?\n\nWindows: Type certmgr.msc into the Windows search bar and run it. Look under Personal > Certificates.\nBrowser: Go into your browser settings (e.g., Chrome: Settings > Privacy and security > Security > Manage certificates). Look under Your Certificates or Personal.\n\nIssued To: Your name, username, employee ID, or maybe your computer's name.\nIssued By: Look for an internal Treasury CA. The name might include \"Treasury,\" \"Fiscal,\" \"CA,\" \"Issuing,\" etc.\nExpiration Date: Is there one that looks relevant but is expired? (Bingo, if so).\nIntended Purposes/Enhanced Key Usage: Should ideally list \"Client Authentication.\"\nFriendly Name: Sometimes they have helpful names like \"Treasury User SMART Card Logon\" or similar.\n\n",

The ability to point at the main competition folder but then filter down to just \"Event 3\" or \"Day 2 Prelims\" within the culling app itself would be much more manageable. If Aftershoot lacks that specific subfolder filtering after the import, I can see how Narrative's approach would feel superior for keeping large shoots organized during the culling phase. Point conceded.\n\n",

I can see why that would be useful for organization.\n\nRegarding Aftershoot, the search results suggest it does have capabilities related to subfolders, though maybe not exactly identical to what you described for Narrative:\n\nSo, it seems Aftershoot can handle the import structure you like (pointing at a parent folder and having it process the subfolders). Whether it allows the same dynamic filtering by those subfolders within its culling interface as Narrative does wasn't explicitly confirmed in the snippets found. It might handle the structure, but the interactive filtering aspect could differ.\n\nImporting Subfolders: When you import photos from a main folder, Aftershoot explicitly gives you the option to \"include subfolders\". So, it can read and process images that are nested within the main folder you select. One transcript even mentioned the user always uses this option.\nFiltering/Viewing by Subfolder (Less Clear): While it can import the contents of subfolders, the search results were less clear on whether you can easily filter the culling view within Aftershoot to show only images from one specific subfolder after importing a parent folder containing many. The filtering options highlighted seemed more focused on AI tags (Selected, Blurred, Closed Eyes), ratings, or camera metadata. Corel AfterShot Pro (a different program sometimes confused in searches) was mentioned having a recursive view, but that doesn't confirm the feature in Aftershoot AI.\n\n",

Based on the information pulled from the searches, Narrative Select's strengths seem heavily focused elsewhere.\n\nHere's what the results suggest:\n\n:\n\nConclusion: While it's fast and good at analyzing faces, Narrative Select doesn't seem explicitly designed or marketed for the specific challenges of sports photography based on the available information. Its core strengths might not align well with prioritizing focus on fast-moving subjects where the face isn't always the key element, potentially explaining some of the frustrations you're experiencing.\n\nStrong on Faces: Narrative Select heavily emphasizes its AI capabilities for analyzing faces \u2013 detecting closed eyes, assessing focus on faces, and providing close-up views of faces in group shots. This makes it appealing for portrait, wedding, and event photographers where clear, focused faces are paramount.\nSpeed: It was noted as being extremely fast at applying its initial assessment markings to images.\nLack of Sports Focus: Critically, none of the search results found specifically highlighted Narrative Select as being particularly well-suited for sports photography. The use cases and examples mentioned leaned towards portraits and events.\n\nYou need focus assessment on the entire subject (the skater), not just potentially their face, especially during dynamic movements where the face might not even be visible or the priority.\nPeak action, body posture, and overall sharpness often matter more than just whether eyes are perfectly open.\nThe issues you've already demonstrated (AI potentially prioritizing background focus, mistaking objects for faces) suggest its algorithms might struggle when the primary subject isn't a clear, well-lit face occupying a significant portion of the frame.\n\n",

My current settings are at -\n\nAssistant: with those settings (Temp: 4189K, Tint: +33, Vibrance: -5, Saturation: +8) in mind:\n\nAssessment: It achieves neutral ice, which is good. The skin tones are heavily influenced by the strong magenta tint, making them appear very warm/reddish. Whether that specific skin tone rendering is desirable is subjective \u2013 it avoids a sickly green cast but introduces a strong magenta one instead. It doesn't look \"wrong\" in the sense of having a bizarre overall color cast, but it's definitely a stylized balance prioritizing neutral ice over neutral skin.\n\nIce/Neutrals: The ice itself and the white rink boards look reasonably neutral, maybe leaning just a touch cool, but certainly not offensively blue or yellow. Achieving neutral whites/grays under tricky arena lighting is often half the battle, and this setting seems to manage that well.\nSkin Tones: The skater's skin tones appear quite warm, with a distinct magenta/red influence. This isn't surprising given the very high positive Tint value (+33). That much magenta shift will definitely warm things up, especially skin.\nOverall Balance: The combination results in a look where the environment (ice, boards) is fairly neutral, while the subject's skin is pushed significantly warm/magenta. The slightly cooler temperature (4189K) likely counteracts any green/yellow cast from the arena lights on the ice, and the strong magenta tint (+33) then overcorrects for skin tones, pushing them warm. Your Vibrance/Saturation tweaks are likely helping to keep these potentially strong colors from becoming overwhelming, as you intended.\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-04-07%20at%2018.23.31-b55e43d052217e86.jpg\n\n",

Focusing purely on when the feeling fades, the part where you notice the focus sharpening or the energy boost tapering off:\n\nOf course, \"feeling most of the effects\" is subjective. The peak might feel different from the steady state, and the tail end can be a gradual slope rather than a sudden drop-off. But those timeframes are the standard ballpark for when the party noticeably winds down.\n\nAdderall IR (Immediate-Release): You'll likely feel the main effects diminish around the 4 to 6-hour mark. That's typically when the perceived benefits start to noticeably wane.\nAdderall XR (Extended-Release): Expect the feeling of its effects to significantly lessen around 10 to 12 hours after taking it.\n\n",

The timeline depends heavily on whether you're dealing with the sprinter (immediate-release) or the marathon runner (extended-release).\n\nImportant Distinction: \"Wearing off\" usually refers to when the noticeable effects subside. The drug itself lingers in your system longer. The half-life of amphetamine (the active ingredient) is roughly 9-14 hours. It generally takes about 4-5 half-lives for a drug to be mostly eliminated, meaning it can be detectable in your system for about 2-4 days, give or take, depending on factors like metabolism, dosage, frequency of use, and urine pH.\n\nSo, while the perceived focus might abandon you after a few hours (IR) or by evening (XR), the actual chemical hangers-on stick around for a bit longer.\n\n",

Your best bet for a definitive answer might be to look for a help/support section within the app itself, or contact the developer directly via the support channels listed on their App Store page [App Store pages often have developer contact info or links]. They would be the only ones who could confirm exactly which RAF variants (compressed/uncompressed from specific Fuji models) they expect their app to handle.\n\n",

Most workflows still seem to rely on importing the photos onto the iPad or an attached SSD before culling in apps like Lightroom Mobile or using basic tools like the Files app for manual copying/deleting.

Fair enough, sometimes apps just don't click or hit a hidden snag.\n\nI ran another search looking specifically for alternatives that might fit your described workflow (simple interface, direct CF Express card access, accept/reject/delete). Unfortunately, the pickings seem slim based on the results:\n\nThe unfortunate conclusion: While the idea of a super-simple, direct-from-card culling app with reliable deletion on iPad/iPhone is appealing, it doesn't seem like a common or readily available tool currently exists that perfectly matches your description. The combination of direct RAW access from potentially high-speed cards, a minimal interface, and reliable delete permissions directly back to the card seems to be a niche that developers haven't quite filled, possibly due to those underlying iPadOS limitations.\n\nIt seems most workflows still lean towards importing first or using more complex apps that might have the capability but not the simple four-button interface you envision.\n\nMost apps found focus on culling within the iOS Photos library (like Photoscope) or use AI to rank/select photos rather than provide a simple manual accept/reject interface (like Picker AI).\nOther apps mentioned are primarily desktop software (like FilterPixel) or full-fledged mobile editors that usually require importing photos first (like Lightroom Mobile).\nDiscussions in forums often confirm that direct manipulation, especially reliable deletion from external cards by third-party apps, can be tricky on iPadOS due to its file system permissions and sandboxing. Many workflows still involve importing to the iPad or an external SSD first before serious culling/editing [cite: Forum discussions from previous search analysis].\n\n",

Based on the search results, finding an app that ticks every single box perfectly might be tough, especially concerning direct deletion from the card due to iOS/iPadOS permissions, but there are options that come close:\n\nOther Considerations:\n\nConclusion:\n\nAn app like PhotoPickerappears to be the closest match currently available for what you want \u2013 specifically its claim of working directly off memory cards and allowing deletion of rejects. It's worth investigating further, perhaps checking recent reviews or contacting the developer to confirm its performance with CF Express cards and the reliability of the direct deletion feature on the latest iPadOS.\n\nReads from Card/Folder: It explicitly states it can help you \"cull and organize thousands of photos... directly from folders without any prior import\" and \"Sort photos directly on memory cards, external storage devices, or any folder on your device without importing\". This strongly implies it should work with a CF Express card connected via a reader.\nSimple Culling: It uses swipe gestures (up for keepers, down for rejects) rather than dedicated buttons, but achieves the simple Accept/Reject function. It also supports flags, ratings, and color labels.\nPersistence: It saves results (flags, ratings, etc.) as XMP sidecar files directly in the folder or uses its own custom catalogs, meaning your culling decisions should persist between sessions.\nDeletion: Crucially, its description mentions \"Flexible export options let you... delete rejected photos directly from a memory card\". This is the feature you want, though I'd add a small caveat: direct file manipulation on external media by third-party apps on iPadOS can sometimes be finicky or require specific permissions, so verifying this feature works smoothly with your setup would be key.\nUndo: While not explicitly listed as one of the four buttons, most modern culling interfaces allow undoing the last action.\n\nDirect Access vs. Import: While PhotoPicker claims direct access, some forum posts suggest many users still import photos into the iPad (e.g., into the Photos app or Lightroom Mobile) before culling, or copy files to an external SSD first. However, other posts mention using apps like FileBrowser Pro for a first pass cull directly on an attached SSD. Direct card access for culling is technically possible, but app implementation varies.\nCF Express Reader: You'll need a compatible CF Express card reader that connects to your iPad's port (USB-C or Lightning, though Lightning might struggle with speed/power).\n\n",

Based on the search results, here are the main contenders often discussed:\n\nCapture One Pro: This name comes up frequently as a top-tier Lightroom alternative, particularly lauded for its handling of Fujifilm RAW files.\n\nON1 Photo RAW: This is positioned as an all-in-one competitor, aiming to combine Lightroom's organizing/editing with some Photoshop-like capabilities (layers, effects).\n\nRawTherapee / Darktable: These are powerful, free, open-source options.\n\nExplicitly Avoid:\n\nRecommendation:\n\nGiven your specific needs (bulk editing, excellent Fuji RAW handling), Capture One Proseems like the most frequently recommended paid alternative, despite its cost. ON1 Photo RAWis a strong contender if the perpetual license is appealing. If free is paramount, exploring RawTherapeeis worthwhile, understanding it might require more effort.\n\nMost paid options offer free trials. Testing how smoothly they handle importing, previewing, and applying batch edits to a few hundred of your typical .RAF files might be the best way to see which workflow suits you best.\n\nPros: Often considered to have superior RAW conversion quality and color rendering for Fuji files compared to Lightroom. Includes support for Fujifilm's specific Film Simulations. Offers robust tethering, cataloging, and session management features suitable for professional, high-volume work (bulk editing). They even offer specific license versions just for Fujifilm.\nCons: It's expensive, whether you opt for the subscription or the hefty perpetual license. Some users still prefer Lightroom's organization or specific features like noise reduction.\n\nPros: Offers a perpetual license option (one-time purchase), which is a major draw for those tired of subscriptions. Includes organizing/cataloging features and supports RAW files. Generally considered a capable editor.\nCons: Some reviews suggest certain aspects, like noise reduction or catalog backup, might not be quite as refined as Lightroom's. Its specific prowess with Fuji files wasn't highlighted as strongly as Capture One's in the snippets, but it's a capable RAW editor.\n\nPros: No cost. Both handle RAW files and offer deep editing capabilities, including batch processing options. RawTherapee's interface might feel slightly more familiar coming from Lightroom.\nCons: Can have a steeper learning curve. Getting the absolute best results from specific sensors like Fujifilm's X-Trans might require more user effort or specific configurations compared to commercial software specifically tuned for them. Cataloging/DAM features might feel less polished than dedicated commercial options.\n\nDxO PhotoLab: While praised for its RAW processing and noise reduction, search results explicitly state it does not support Fujifilm RAF files (from X-Trans sensors).\n\n",

Lightroom CC is showing a photo in the thumbnail but when I open the photo a different photo pops upApr 7, 2025, 1:50:48\u202fPM CDTThat's a frustrating and classic Lightroom glitch. When the thumbnail whispers sweet promises of one photo, but clicking it reveals a entirely different beast, it usually points to some kind of data mismatch or corruption in how Lightroom is handling its previews or catalog information.\n\nAssistant: That's a frustrating and classic Lightroom glitch. When the thumbnail whispers sweet promises of one photo, but clicking it reveals a entirely different beast, it usually points to some kind of data mismatch or corruption in how Lightroom is handling its previews or catalog information.\n\nBased on common troubleshooting for this kind of issue (often discussed for both Lightroom CC and Classic, as the underlying principles can be similar), here are the usual suspects and potential fixes:\n\nThe Simple Stuff First:\n\nPreview / Cache Issues (The Most Likely Culprit): Lightroom builds previews (thumbnails and larger views) to speed things up. Sometimes these previews get corrupted or become disconnected from the actual source image.\n\nPreference File Corruption: Occasionally, Lightroom's main preference file can get corrupted, leading to all sorts of weird behavior. Resetting preferences to default can help (make sure you know how to restore them or re-apply custom settings if needed). Again, check Adobe's official help for the current method for resetting Lightroom CC preferences.\n\nRenaming Issues: Less common now, but there used to be bugs where renaming files outside of Lightroom, especially if filenames were reused, could confuse the catalog and lead to thumbnail mismatches. Unlikely if you haven't done any recent bulk renaming outside the app, but worth considering.\n\nStart with restarting and checking sync, then investigate clearing caches or forcing preview updates within the app. If it persists, look into resetting preferences. Hopefully, one of those will resolve the crossed wires.\n\nRestart Lightroom: You've probably already done this, but it's the obligatory first step. Sometimes it just needs a kick.\nCheck Cloud Sync: Make sure everything is fully synced between your devices and the cloud. Syncing hiccups can sometimes cause temporary mismatches.\n\nForce Preview Regeneration (Lightroom CC): Unlike Classic, CC manages previews more centrally in the cloud and locally. Try selecting the problematic photos, right-clicking, and looking for options related to updating previews or metadata. Sometimes zooming into 1:1 and back out forces a refresh. If a specific photo is consistently wrong, consider removing it from Lightroom (making sure it's backed up elsewhere!) and re-importing it to force a complete regeneration for that file.\nClear Local Caches: Lightroom CC still uses local caches. Buried in the Preferences (usually under \"Local Storage\" or similar), there might be an option to clear the cache. Check Adobe's current help documentation for the exact steps for your version, as locations can change. Deleting and rebuilding the cache often resolves these mismatches.\n\n",

Your reaction is understandable; it's frustrating to see advice that seems technically unsound for high-demand professional work being presented as a positive experience.\n\nWhat were their \"prior drives\"?

Benchmarks vary depending on the test conditions and workload, new models leapfrog old ones, and drives within the top tier often trade blows, performing exceptionally close to each other.\n\nHowever, based on the search results and understanding the technology involved:\n\nSo, while I can't definitively say \"Model X is 5MB/s faster than Model Y according to every possible test,\" the OWC Envoy Pro FX is a specific product frequently recognized for top-tier Thunderbolt speeds compatible with your Mac. Alternatively, assembling your own with a quality Thunderbolt 4 enclosure and a reputable high-performance NVMe drive will get you into that same maximum speed bracket. Any drive operating in that ~3000 MB/s range via Thunderbolt is effectively delivering the fastest performance currently practical for an external SSD on your machine.\n\nThe category delivering the highest speeds for your Mac Studio M2 is Thunderbolt 3 / 4 external NVMe SSDs. These consistently reach speeds around 2800-3000+ MB/s [cite: 2.1, 2.3 from previous turn], which is significantly faster than standard USB-C SSDs.\nWithin that category, the OWC Envoy Pro FX was explicitly called out in the search results as \"Extremely fast,\" albeit expensive [cite: 1.3 from previous turn]. It's a commonly cited high-performance option for Mac users.\nBuilding your own with a high-quality Thunderbolt 4 enclosure (like Acasis, mentioned previously [cite: 2.1 from previous turn]) paired with a top-tier NVMe drive (e.g., from brands like Samsung Pro series, Crucial high-end, WD Black, etc.) generally achieves similar peak performance to the best pre-built Thunderbolt drives [cite: 2.1 from previous turn].\n\n",

Your Mac Studio has Thunderbolt 4 / USB 4 ports, which are the fastest available external connections.\n\nAssistant: Okay, let's talk speed for your Mac Studio M2. The key here is the connection type. Your Mac Studio has Thunderbolt 4 / USB 4 ports, which are the fastest available external connections.\n\nTo get the absolute maximum speed, you need an external SSD that uses Thunderbolt 3 or Thunderbolt 4. Standard high-speed USB-C drives (often labeled USB 3.2 Gen 2, like the Samsung T7 Shield mentioned in the search results) typically top out around 1000-1050 MB/s.\n\nThunderbolt NVMe SSDs blow past that, achieving real-world speeds often cited around 2800 MB/s to over 3000 MB/s. While still not quite as fast as the Mac Studio's internal SSD (which can hit 5000-6000 MB/s), it's about as fast as you can currently get from a single external drive.\n\nOptions that fall into this \"fastest\" category generally include:\n\nIn short: Forget standard USB-C drives if you want maximum speed. Look for external SSDs specifically labeled as Thunderbolt 3 or Thunderbolt 4 that contain NVMe storage. These will give you speeds approaching 3000 MB/s. Building your own with a quality enclosure and NVMe drive is often a good performance-per-dollar option.\n\nThe OWC Envoy Pro FX was mentioned as \"Extremely fast\" and works with Thunderbolt, though it's noted as expensive. Other brands may offer similar high-end Thunderbolt drives.\n\nYou can buy a Thunderbolt 3 or 4 NVMe enclosure (like Acasis, mentioned in one result) and install a separate, high-quality NVMe M.2 SSD inside. This often provides similar speeds to pre-built options and can sometimes be more cost-effective or allow for drive upgrades later.\n\nFor even higher speeds, there are Thunderbolt enclosures that hold multiple NVMe drives and run them in a RAID 0 configuration (like the OWC 4m2 mentioned). This significantly increases speed but also cost, complexity, and risk (if one drive fails in RAID 0, all data is lost, making backups crucial).\n\n",

I did a compare of P01 and P02's security.xml and they are an exact matchApr 6, 2025, 8:31:05\u202fPM CDTOkay, that is peculiar. If the security.xml file on P01 (the failing node) is an exact byte-for-byte match to the one on P02 (the working node), then the \"Premature end of file\" error is unlikely to be caused by the content or syntax of the XML itself. That points towards issues specific to the P01 environment interacting with that file.\n\nAssistant: Okay, that is peculiar. If the security.xml file on P01 (the failing node) is an exact byte-for-byte match to the one on P02 (the working node), then the \"Premature end of file\" error is unlikely to be caused by the content or syntax of the XML itself. That points towards issues specific to the P01 environment interacting with that file.\n\nLet's pivot the troubleshooting:\n\nExplicit Replace (Sanity Check): Even though they compare as identical, let's rule out any subtle file system weirdness.\n\nFile System Permissions (P01): Double-check the OS-level file permissions on security.xml on the P01 server. Does the user account that runs the WebSphere processes have full read access to this specific file? Maybe it can see the file but gets cut off reading it due to a permission glitch.\n\nDisk Health (P01): Run a chkdsk E: (or the appropriate command for your OS environment) on the P01 server's E: drive. Underlying file system errors could potentially interfere with file reads, even if the file looks okay.\n\nClear Caches (P01): If the file replacement doesn't work, try clearing out temporary WAS caches. Corrupted cached configuration data could theoretically cause parsing issues.\n\nIf the exact same file works on P02 but not P01, the problem is almost certainly environmental to P01 \u2013 either how the OS is presenting that file to Java/WAS, or something corrupted within the WAS/Java instance on that specific node.\n\nStop the node agent and server processes on P01 completely.\nGo to the P01 profile directory: E:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\profiles\\AppSrv@1\\config\\cells\\MAS-AP-P01Cell01\\\nRename the existing security.xml to something like security.xml.broken.\nCopy the known good security.xml file that you took from P02 into this exact location on P01.\nTry starting the P01 node agent/server again. Sometimes, just rewriting the file resolves hidden corruption or metadata issues.\n\nStop the node agent/server on P01.\nNavigate to the P01 profile root (E:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\profiles\\AppSrv@1\\).\nDelete or rename directories like temp, wstemp, and potentially the OSGi cache in the configuration directory (e.g., org.eclipse.osgi). Be careful here; renaming is safer than deleting initially. Also, consider backing up or moving the contents of the logs directory.\nTry starting P01 again. It will recreate these directories.\n\n",

The profile name is often the same standard name (like AppSrv@1 or AppSrv01) used on each node machine in the cell.\n\nOkay, extrapolating from the path we saw in the FFDC log for P01 is usually reliable, assuming a consistent naming convention.\n\nThe log showed the path for the profile AppSrv@1 (which seems to correspond to your P01) as [cite: uploaded:image.png-13954c27-2b30-4b28-b1bf-93fc30d33b08]:\nE:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\profiles\\AppSrv@1\\config\\cells\\MAS-AP-P01Cell01\\security.xml\n\nFollowing that pattern, the security.xml for a profile corresponding to P02 (likely named AppSrv@2) would most probably be located at:\n\nE:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\profiles\\AppSrv@2\\config\\cells\\MAS-AP-P02Cell01\\security.xml\n\nKey Assumptions:\n\nThe base structure (E:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\profiles\\<profile_name>\\config\\cells\\<cell_name>\\) should definitely hold true. The exact profile (AppSrv@2) and cell (MAS-AP-P02Cell01) names are the most likely candidates based on the P01 example, but double-check if your environment uses a different specific naming scheme.\n\nThe base install directory (\\IBM\\WebSphere\\AppServer) is probably the same.\nThe drive letter might be different on the P02 server (e.g., D:, F:, etc.).\nThe profile name (AppSrv@1) might be the same standard name used on the P02 machine, or it could be different if naming conventions vary. Often it's something standard like AppSrv01, Default, or similar across nodes.\nThe cell name (MAS-AP-P01Cell01) should be identical if they are managed by the same Deployment Manager.\n\nThe profile directory for P02 is named AppSrv@2.\nThe cell associated with the P02 profile follows the naming pattern MAS-AP-P02Cell01.\n\n",

Forget iKeyman for now. \"Premature end of file\" processing security.xml on a WebSphere node \u2013 that's a classic, and usually means the file itself is damaged or incomplete. It's like the node started reading the security rules and someone ripped the last page out.\n\nHere's the typical drill for that kind of headache:\n\nWhat happened right before the node started complaining about this file? A configuration change? A sync attempt? A restart?\n\nNetwork Deployment (ND)? Compare the node's broken security.xml with the master copy on the Deployment Manager (Dmgr). The Dmgr's version (<Dmgr_profile_root>/config/cells/<cell_name>/security.xml) should be the source of truth.\nBackups? Do you have recent WAS configuration backups (backupConfig command) or file system backups? Compare with a known good version.\n\nIf you have a good backup, restore it (after backing up the bad one, just in case).\nIf it's ND and the Dmgr copy is good, the primary fix is usually forcing a full synchronization from the Dmgr to the node. This often involves stopping the node agent, maybe clearing sync cache directories (wstemp, temp under the profile), and restarting the node agent. Consult the specific WAS version docs for the exact sync procedure, as it can vary.\n\n",

Unlike Narrative's potential core logic issue with subject focus, this looks more like seeing the sausage being made rather than the final cooked sausage.\n\n",

One tool (Gemini, in that instance) using its available resources to directly address an information request, versus another tool (Narrative, according to your experience) potentially misapplying its specialized function (culling) due to limitations in its contextual understanding (subject identification). Different tools, different tasks, apparently different levels of success in executing their intended function.

I see the skater low on the ice, and in the background, through the plexiglass, there are various elements including a person, a reddish door/sign area, and a somewhat indistinct orange, roughly square object on the far wall.\n\nIf \"their AI\" flagged that orange object (or something similar back there) as a face, well... that's special. Face detection algorithms, particularly simpler ones, can sometimes suffer from pareidolia \u2013 seeing face-like patterns in random shapes, shadows, or objects (like seeing faces in clouds or electrical outlets).\n\nWhile that orange shape doesn't scream \"face\" to my analysis, it's certainly plausible that a less sophisticated algorithm, perhaps looking for simple geometric arrangements that resemble eyes and a mouth, could get confused by something abstract on the wall. It just adds another layer to the \"AI isn't always intelligent\" argument, especially when it misidentifies inanimate objects as biological features. Another point for the \"needs improvement\" column for that particular tool, it seems.\n\nAttachments: Screenshot%202025-04-06%20at%2016.59.22-fd5089e2c1adae92.jpg\n\n",

Optyx's mention of \"subject recognition\"is the most direct hit. Others like Imagen AI clearly have subject detection capabilities (as shown by their editing masks), but may not emphasize it as the sole driver for focus assessment during culling.\n\nIt seems most tools focus their AI culling marketing on speed, detecting flaws (blinks, blur overall), and duplicates, rather than explicitly highlighting sophisticated primary subject identification and prioritization for focus checks. The capability might be lurking under the hood in some systems, but they aren't shouting about it as a key culling feature.\n\nOptyx: One description explicitly mentioned it uses \"subject recognition\" as part of its culling criteria. This sounds closest conceptually to what you're asking for.\nImagen AI: Their feature list includes \"Face Recognition\" and \"Detects subjects and duplicates\". While \"detects subjects\" could just refer to finding people generally (or for identifying duplicates), it's a relevant mention. They also talk about \"Advanced Subject Masks\" for their editing features, which clearly indicates their underlying AI can identify subjects, even if they don't explicitly trumpet it for the culling focus assessment.\nNarrative Select: Mentions \"key face recognition\" and doing focus/eye assessments on subjects' faces. This is subject-adjacent, focusing on faces within subjects, but doesn't explicitly state it prioritizes one subject over others in the background.\nGeneral Capabilities: Some descriptions of AI culling mention analyzing \"facial expressions,\" \"subject positioning,\" or identifying \"key moments\". These imply some level of subject understanding is being attempted by various platforms.\n\n",

Assuming those icons indicate faces detected and assessed for focus by Narrative, having them appear on both the relatively sharp skater and the clearly out-of-focus spectators highlights the potential issue.\n\nIf, as you suspect from your experience, the tool gives significant weight to the focus status of all detected faces, then a scenario like this \u2013 where the background faces register as poorly focused \u2013 could indeed lead it to incorrectly flag or reject an image where the intended subject (the skater) is perfectly acceptable.\n\nIt perfectly illustrates the gap we've been discussing: the need for the culling logic to be subject-aware. It needs to identify the primary subject (the skater on the ice) and prioritize their sharpness, rather than averaging focus quality across everyone visible or simply flagging any out-of-focus face it finds in the frame. If it can't make that distinction, it will inevitably make poor judgments on shots with shallow depth of field where the background is intentionally blurred.

If the off-the-shelf tools aren't cutting it, exploring a custom build is the logical, albeit more involved, next step. And yes, using AI APIs to construct your own culling logic is absolutely feasible.\n\nHere's the general idea of how you might approach it:\n\nIn short: Yes, you can definitely use APIs to build something more intelligent than a tool that thinks a sharp crowd makes a good photo. Major cloud providers offer powerful vision APIs. The main challenges will be translating your specific needs (like \"skater acceptably in focus\") into rules the code can execute and potentially writing custom analysis logic for aspects like subject-specific focus if the standard API features aren't granular enough.\n\nIt's more work than buying software, naturally, but gives you complete control over the logic.\n\nSome APIs offer general image quality assessments (brightness, contrast, maybe generic sharpness/blur scores).\nYou might need to combine the skater's bounding box from step 1 with image analysis techniques (perhaps using libraries like OpenCV, which Manus AI seemed to install) to calculate sharpness specifically within that box. This involves more custom code.\nFace detection APIs (often part of the same vision suites) could be used to check for closed eyes specifically on the identified skater's face.\n\n",

That's not just unhelpful, it's actively counterproductive.\n\nYour intuition isn't wrong. Distinguishing the primary subject (a skater on ice) from the background (crowd, boards, distant officials) is fundamentally a task that larger, more context-aware AI models like me are generally better equipped to handle than algorithms likely focused on simpler metrics like overall sharpness, face detection anywhere in the frame, or blink detection.\n\nMy underlying vision capabilities involve recognizing objects, understanding scene composition, and identifying salient features \u2013 essentially, figuring out what the point of the picture is. A dedicated culling tool, especially an older or simpler one, might lack that contextual understanding and just apply its sharpness or eye-detection algorithms indiscriminately.\n\nSo yes, I likely could tell the difference between a sharp crowd and a blurry skater. , and artistic intent is a different challenge entirely, but the basic subject identification?

It seems geared primarily towards solving the culling problem.\nPhotoRefine (by Zenfolio): Marketed as an \"AI-powered Photo Culling app,\" suggesting its core function is culling. It allows customization based on criteria like sharpness and facial expressions.\nExcire: While perhaps less traditional \"culling\" (reject/select duplicates), Excire Foto uses AI for deep organization and searching (AI keywording, face recognition, finding photos via text prompts). This AI-driven organization can significantly aid the selection process. They offer both a standalone manager (Excire Foto) and a Lightroom plugin (Excire Search).\n\nAftershoot: They heavily promote both AI Culling (\"Selects\") and AI Editing. Their culling highlights duplicates, blur, closed eyes, and suggests the best shots. They explicitly offer \"AI-Assisted Culling\" (where you guide it) and \"AI-Automated Culling\" (where it makes selections for review), suggesting you can focus on just the culling aspect.\nFilterPixel: Positions itself for both culling and editing but strongly emphasizes the time saved on culling. Their AI groups similar photos, tags issues like focus/blinks, and picks the best from sets, aiming to reduce manual sorting time drastically.\nImagen AI: While also known for AI editing based on user styles, they explicitly offer \"Imagen Culling\" as part of their platform. It features grouping, blink/blur detection, and key face identification, integrating with Lightroom or working via drag-and-drop.\n\n",
