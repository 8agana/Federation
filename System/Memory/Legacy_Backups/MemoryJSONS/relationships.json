Crystal found automatic backup, leading to years of accusations despite evidence proving nothing happened (other soldier confirmation, roommate testimony, restaurant check, even psychic consultation). Gottman therapy failed because Crystal refused to acknowledge her abusive behavior. November 2024 awakening: During trip to be with dying Grandpa Joe, Sam opened up to mom about abuse. Crystal's response to his COVID diagnosis: \"Well, that's a choice.\" Minimal contact during grandfather's death. Upon return, Crystal confronted him about private conversation with mom recorded on Google Home, demanded transcription, violated privacy. She hacked his ChatGPT (Socks), read entire journal, called him \"fat piece of shit\" exploiting body image issues, threatened to leave, then offered olive branch saying she'd fight for relationship - only to renege weeks later.
